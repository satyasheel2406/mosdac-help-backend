Summary 
Existing aerosol algorithms providing aerosol information over land take advantage of measurement 
in narrow bands falling in the wide spectral range from 0.4 to 2.5 µm or of polarization/multi-angle 
viewing capabilities or both. Most of the ISRO’s space-borne sensors only partially fulfil the mentioned 
capabilities. As far as the requirement of narrow multiple channels in the visible region, and 
radiometric quality of the measurement is concerned, Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) on-board 
OceanSat-2 seems to be a good choice, however, spectral coverage in OCM-2 is only up to 0.865 µm, 
which omitted the idea of aerosol remote sensing over land with existing algorithm. For this reason, 
to date OCM-2 was limited to ocean colour applications only. 
This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes a novel algorithm for remote sensing of 
aerosol over land using spectral reflectance observed by OCM-2. The algorithm retrieves the aerosol 
optical depth (AOD) as the primary product and fine mode fraction as a proxy for the size distribution 
(can be associated with anthropogenic sources) of the undisturbed aerosol column over most of the 
Indian landmass. The unique characteristic of OCM-2 is the presence of two narrow blue channels 
(0.44 and 0.49 um), which is taken as an advantage in this algorithm for the resolution of aerosol type 
while optical depth inversion. The presence of two blue channels also allows full use of red and near-
infrared (NIR) channels for surface characterization without any assumption on the transparency of 
aerosol in red and NIR bands. These two facts make this algorithm different from existing ones and 
also make aerosol remote sensing possible with OCM-2 sensor which does not have measurement 
capabilities beyond NIR like MODIS, VIIRS, and GOES-R, and do not have multi- viewings like MISR and 
PARASOL. The high brightness combined with spatial homogeneity of clouds in visible channels allows 
reasonably good cloud rejection while aerosol estimation. Co-located sun photometer validation is 
provided for the aerosol product.  
The prime objectives for developing this aerosol product are to cater main input for air-quality, 
radiative budget, and climate applications, especially over Indian landmass.  The high spatial 
resolution of 700 meters makes this product unique among globally available aerosol products. Apart 
from these, it will open the door for the utilization of OCM-2 data for other land applications also. 
Since OCM-2 in local area coverage mode have 2-day repetivity, the temporal resolution of OCM-2 
AOD is two days, with an exception for the overlap region where daily retrievals are possible.

2.0 Introduction 
2.1 Overview and background 
Aerosols play an important role in numerous aspects of human life. Aerosols have largescale 
effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (IPCC 2007; Charlson et al. 
1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et 
al. 2002). Aerosol information is also critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-
spectral satellite sensors and military operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may 
be comparable to carbon dioxide greenhouse effects, but with opposite signs and larger 
uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, 1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the 
climate element. When in the lower troposphere aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of 
visibility, and public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol 
distribution at global and regional scales.  
This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the algorithm used to retrieve the 
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for the OCM-2 instrument onboard OceanSat-2 a polar-orbiting 
platform. The output product description is summarized in Table 1.  
Specifically, this document identifies the sources of input data, both OCM-2 data and non- OCM-2 
data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and mathematical background underlying 
the use of this information in the retrievals; includes implementation details; describes 
assumptions and limitations of the proposed approach.

2.2 Objectives 
The primary objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical depth, proportional to the 
total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over land for the Indian region using OCM-2 data. The 
8 
 
secondary objective is to derive fine-mode fraction which is a proxy information about the particle 
size distribution and can be associated with anthropogenic sources of aerosols. The overall 
objectives of the aerosol retrieval are:  
 
To determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 550 nm and 700-meter spatial resolution 
over land within an uncertainty of 20%.  
 
To derive fine mode fraction as a qualitative indicator of anthropogenic pollution sources. 
As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical depth cannot be found for cloudy pixels 
therefore optical thickness retrievals apply only under clear and daytime conditions.

Aerosol retrievals from polar-orbiting satellite data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of NASA’s, Aqua and Terra Satellites, Visible Infrared Imaging 
Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), PARASOL are the major 
sources of high-quality global estimates of AOD over land and oceans (Kaufman et al., 1997; Levy 
et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2004, 2006, 2013).  All of these sensors of foreign space agencies are 
equipped with the channels to measure radiances in several narrow visible, near Infrared (NIR) 
and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. In addition to measuring un-polarized spectral 
radiances at a single scattering angle, some of these sensors such as MISR and PARASOL can also 
measure un-polarized as well as polarized radiances at several scattering angles, thus providing 
more scope to improve the accuracy of AOD retrieval as well as aerosol optical properties. Most 
of these sensors utilize the dark-target method over dark vegetated surfaces and the deep-blue 
method over bright surfaces to retrieve AOD products. Both of these methods require spectral 
radiance measurement in at least three visible channels (near 440,490, 620 nm) and two SWIR 
channels (1.24 & 2.12 um) for aerosol retrieval in addition to channels required for masking 
unwanted target pixels.  
As far as Indian satellites are concerned, none of the existing sensors fulfils the requirements of 
measurement in all channels especially the SWIR channels, which is crucial for aerosol retrieval. 
Most of the spaceborne optical imaging sensors onboard different Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) 
satellites such as OceanSat (1, 2 and upcoming 3), CARTOSAT (1, 2 and 3) and RESOURCESAT (1 
and 2), etc. were designed for specific applications related to Earth surface (land and ocean) 
monitoring and mapping, as in various EOS missions, and were not designed to accommodate 
channels for aerosol studies. For this reason, the existing AOD retrieval techniques requiring SWIR 
and visible channels, in multiple wavelengths, cannot be used for Aerosol retrieval from any of the 
ISRO sensors’ data. INSAT-3D/3DR is the only exception, where utilizing the advantage of fixed 
view geometry due to Geostationary platform, a basic AOD product using single visible channel 
data without the need of SWIR measurement is operationally generated and is available for public 
use, on the SAC/VEDAS site (Mishra et al., 2018). However, this method is not so efficient or 
accurate and is not suited to good accuracy aerosol retrieval, which limits its use to qualitative 
estimate purpose, and time-series change monitoring only.  
The reason for less research work toward the development of aerosol retrieval algorithm for 
single-view visible to near-infrared (VNIR) sensor in past may be due to significant aerosol 
contamination in the entire VNIR spectral range that makes surface characterization a difficult 
problem. Moreover, since electromagnetic radiation of SWIR (2µm) wavelength minimally interact 
10 
 
with aerosols therefore researchers found MODIS-like sensors more feasible for developing 
relatively simpler aerosol retrieval algorithm.  
Thus, due to the impracticality of implementation of existing AOD retrieval methods to ISRO’s 
operational satellites’ data, routine accurate AOD retrieval could not be done. However, 
extremely poor air quality over Indian landmass, especially the urban centers, and the high priority 
requirement from Environment Ministries, for high resolution (sub kilometres) aerosol 
estimations to generate ground-level PM2.5/PM10 maps, using existing Indian satellite sensor’s 
data, an urgent need was there to develop techniques for retrieving reliable and accurate aerosol 
information from the existing Indian satellite sensors. Recent research work at Space Applications 
Center, ISRO, provides a unique solution to this. The research has led to the development of a 
Novel Technique, which can retrieve AOD from Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data onboard IRS 
OceanSat-2 satellite, which was launched in 2009 and is still in-service. This Algorithm Theoretical 
Basis Document briefly describes this aerosol algorithm and the aerosol product of which 
AOD@550 nm beta version is currently operational at VEDAS/SAC/ISRO air quality portal 
(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vstatic/AQ/index.html).

4.2 Instrument Characteristics 
The OceanSat-2 was launched in 2009 and was placed in a near-circular sun-synchronous orbit, at 
an altitude of 720 Km, with an equatorial crossing time of around 1200 hrs. Ocean Colour Monitor 
is a VNIR sensor on-board OceanSat-2, which acquires top of the atmosphere radiance in 8 narrow 
spectral channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, 490, 510, 550, 620, 740, and 865 nm with 
high radiometric accuracy. Since 2010 (i.e., for the last 11 years) OCM-2 is continuously providing 
data over the ocean as well as on land and is still in service. Since OCM-2 is particularly designed 
for ocean colour studies, the ocean observation is planned at the local time of equator crossing 
11 
 
time of 1200 hours noon, the camera can be tilted up to ± 20° in the along-track direction to avoid 
sun glint. Table 2 shows the salient characteristics of the OCM-2 sensor. Figure 1 shows the 
spectral responses of the channels. OCM-2 data is available in two spatial resolutions: Local Area 
Coverage (LAC) of 360 m and Global Area Coverage (GAC) of 1 km. To meet the objective of 
covering oceans around the Indian region, Real-Time LAC data is routinely received at the NRSC 
primary ground station. The area of coverage in LAC mode is shown in figure 2. Table 3 shows 
various performance parameters of OCM-2.

4.3 Theoretical background 
AOD  𝜏   is the measure of aerosols distributed within the column of air from the ground instrument 
to the top of the atmosphere or from the space-borne sensor to the surface. AOD is the degree to 
which aerosol prevents the transmission of the light by absorption or scattering of light and is 
defined as the integrated extinction coefficient of light due to aerosol over a vertical atmospheric 
column of unit cross-section (mathematically represented by equation 1). Extinction coefficient 
𝐾𝑒𝑥𝑡  is defined as the fractional depletion of radiance per unit length.

The following description is intended to provide the basic structure of the algorithm that can 
derive aerosol optical depth and fine mode fraction from OceanSat-2 OCM data, which acquires 
top of the atmosphere radiance in 8 narrow spectral channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, 
490, 510, 550, 620, 740 and 865 nm with high radiometric accuracy. The overall workflow for the 
proposed algorithm/technique for aerosol retrieval using OCM-2 data is shown in section 4.4. It 
mainly involves four components:  
(a) Masking of the pixel for which retrieval is not possible (e.g., cloud, water, and saturated pixels), 
(b) The surface characterization in visible-channels,  
(c) Radiative transfer simulation, and  
(d) The aerosol inversion.

The aerosol retrieval algorithm described in this ATBD is novel/different from other existing 
aerosol retrieval algorithms such as dark-target or deep-blue in many ways that make it capable 
to derive aerosols from VNIR sensors. Following are the salient points of the algorithm: 
(a) The surface characterization in visible channels is shown to be possible by the use of near 
Infrared channel measurements, where the existing algorithm uses the SWIR channel over 
dark targets and reflectivity database over bright surfaces. Thus this algorithm avoids the 
necessity of SWIR measurement as well as doesn’t require the pre-existence of a surface 
reflectivity database. 
(b) Different from the dark-target algorithm, the surface characterization strategy in this 
algorithm is not limited to vegetative surfaces but is also valid over moderately bright surfaces, 
which enables AOD retrieval over both moderately bright as well as dark surfaces. 
(c) Different from the dark-target, deep-blue algorithm and others where blue and red channels 
are used for aerosol inversion, in this algorithm aerosol inversion is based on two blue 
channels which allows more accurate selection of aerosol types and also increases the 
probability of retrieval over bright targets.  
Apart from this many other differences such as red and NIR bands are not assumed transparent, 
simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface in NIR and red bands, etc., makes the current aerosol 
retrieval algorithm novel when compared to existing ones, though none of them are feasible for 
implementation with OCM-2 sensor. 
4.3.1 Gas absorption 
In addition to the aerosols and molecular scattering, certain atmospheric gases may also affect 
OCM-2 channels. In the VNIR region, primarily three atmospheric gas may absorb the incident 
solar radiation and upwelling radiation namely water vapour (H2O), ozone (O3), and oxygen (O2). 
The expression for ozone optical thickness, 𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM: 
𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) = 𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) 𝐷𝑈     
 
 
 
 
(1) 
where, 𝐷𝑈 refer to total column ozone in Dobson unit and  𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) is the extinction coefficient 
that relates optical thickness with concentration. Table 4 show the values of  𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM-
2 channels. From table 4 it can be seen that band-5 and band-6 centered at 550 and 620 nm, 
respectively are significantly affected by ozone absorption. The top of the atmosphere radiance 
is corrected by ozone transmittance. The relation for the ozone transmittance is: 
𝑇𝑜𝑧= exp [−𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆){(𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃)−1 + (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃0)−1}]   
 
 (2) 
14 
 
Since OCM-2 channels are selected in atmospheric windows, therefore, absorption due to water 
vapour and oxygen is expected to be insignificant. To verify this figure 3 shows the 
transmittance due to water vapour at different concentrations (2, 4, and 6 cm) and the standard 
value of oxygen for the tropical atmosphere. From figure 3, it is clear that that band 2, 3, 5 and 
6 are completely free from the water vapour or oxygen absorption. Band 8 is also almost free 
from water vapour but with very little contamination, however. Table 5 shows the water vapour 
transmittance obtained after convolving the transmittance curve with band-8 spectral response 
function, where form it is verified that the contamination is not more than 1% even at high 
water vapour content of around 6 cm. There may be an error of about 1-2% if water vapour 
content is very high >6 cm but such conditions are rare and often gets masked as clouds.

4.3.2 Cloud and inland water masking 
Masking clouds retaining heavy aerosol events unmasked is very challenging in any aerosol 
retrieval algorithm. In normal conditions, heavy/thick clouds can be distinguished and masked 
just by applying an appropriate threshold on visible channel measurements, however, thin 
clouds especially at cloud edges frequently create problems. An astringent threshold can be 
used to mask such pixels but it also masks heavy aerosol plumes. For this reason in the present 
algorithm, a visible channel threshold is used to mask thick clouds only. For masking scattered 
clouds, a spatial homogeneity test is performed by estimating the standard deviation over a 
running window of 3x3 pixels. An appropriate threshold is used to detect scattered cloudy 
pixels keeping the fact in mind that the land surface is more homogeneous than the scattered 
clouds. For cloud masking following 2 tests are performed: 
(a) Visible channel (band-2) reflectance threshold test: 
 𝜌443 𝑛𝑚 > 0.30             Pixel is considered cloudy.                                        (3) 
(b) Threshold test on the standard deviation of a running 3 x 3-pixel window of band-2 image.  
𝜎443𝑛𝑚,3 𝑥 3 > 0.02             Center pixel is considered cloudy.                    (4) 
The inland water mask is determined by computing the traditional NDVI like parameter 
(NDVI’) for the 0.62 μm and the 0.865 μm channels.  
𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼′ =
𝜌𝐵8,𝑇𝑂𝐴−𝜌𝐵6,𝑇𝑂𝐴
𝜌𝐵8,𝑇𝑂𝐴+𝜌𝐵6,𝑇𝑂𝐴 
 
 
                                            (5) 
If  𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼′ < 0.05 then the pixel is considered water contaminated and is masked. 
The test for pixel saturation is also performed using saturation radiance (𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡 ) values for each 
band. If measured radiance (𝐿𝐵) in any band satisfies the condition 
 𝐿𝐵> 𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡                                             
 
 
    
             (6) 
then the pixel is considered saturated and is masked. 
Any pixel with solar zenith angle (𝜃0) or sensor zenith angle (𝜃0) above-given limits are also 
masked. The condition for the high zenith angle test is given by: 
𝜃0 > 720     or   𝜃> 840   
 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 
4.3.3 Physical basis and model for surface characterization 
The physical basis behind surface characterization in visible channels using NIR 
channels is based on the fact that over the vegetated surface, the surface reflectance 
in the blue spectral region is low due to absorption of solar radiation by chlorophyll while in 
the NIR region the surface reflectance becomes high due to specular reflection from the 
16 
 
leaves. Using this fact appropriate function of the form shown in equation 8 can be developed 
to characterize the surface reflectance in blue and red channels knowing the surface 
reflectance in NIR channels and an appropriate vegetation index. For the case of OCM-2 data, 
the vegetation index used is NDVI, blue and red, and NIR channels used are centered at 443 
nm, 490 nm, 620 nm, and 865 nm.

For developing relation given in equation (8), around 1860 OCM-2 datasets (for the year 2017) 
were processed and corrected for aerosol and gas absorption at 22 AERONET stations (located 
in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar)  using in-situ aerosol, water vapour, and 
ozone information. After cloud screening of both AERONET and OCM-2 data around 700 co-
located data-points are selected for model development. Radiative transfer calculations were 
used to generate benchmark datasets of surface reflectance for each spectral channel. The 
performance of function developed to estimate band-3 and band-6 surface reflectance using 
NIR channel is shown in figure 3. From figure 3 it is seen that surface reflectance in band-3 can 
be estimated using both red as well as NIR bands and NDVI within root mean square error 
(rmse) of around 0.02. For lower surface reflectance the scatter is less while on bright surfaces 
the significant scatter is observed. In figure 4, the data point density is higher for low surface 
reflectance pixels, which in general true as natural targets are dark in blue wavelengths, 
therefore excluding bright surface the rmse will become significantly lower than 0.02. In a 
similar way, function to estimate surface reflectivity in band-2 using band-3 is also developed.

reflectance obtained by atmospheric correction using in-situ data.

4.3.4 Radiative transfer calculations 
Radiative Transfer (RT) simulation is another important step towards aerosol retrieval in which 
the method of discrete ordinate is used to solve the RT equation (equation 11) for simulating 
various radiative quantities for different possible aerosol atmospheres and illumination-view 
geometries.

Solving this equation, the top of the atmosphere radiance (𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡
∗
)  can be computed assuming 
tropical atmosphere in the range of 0.4-1.0 𝜇𝑚 at the spectral resolution of 0.0025𝜇𝑚, which 
are then convoluted to OCM-2 spectral response functions to simulate observations. The 
radiative scattering due to aerosols is simulated assuming 2 fine aerosol models defined as 
moderately and strongly absorbing aerosols, and 1 coarse aerosol model named dust aerosol 
model. The optical properties (extinction and scattering coefficients, single scattering albedo, 
phase function, and asymmetry factor) of the basic modes (accumulation and coarse modes) are 
computed from the Mie theory assuming multi-modal log-normal distribution defined by 
𝑛(𝑟) = ∑

𝑙𝑛2𝑟/𝑟𝑚,𝑖

             (12) 
where 𝑁 is the number of modes, 𝑟 is the particle radius, 𝑟𝑚,𝑖 is the mean radius of mode 𝑖, 𝜎𝑖 
is the width of mode 𝑖, and 𝑓𝑖 is the number density of mode 𝑖. These parameters and the 
refractive index (𝑚𝑖= 𝑚𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙+ 𝑚𝑖,𝑖𝑚𝑔) for each mode used in Mie calculations are taken from 
Levy et al., 2007. An exponential profile of AOD with a scaled height of 2 km is assumed. In 
the current version of the algorithm, to reduce the computational time of operational retrieval 
of AOD, RT simulation-based look-up-tables (LUTs) are generated and saved as the auxiliary 
database, which is used to calculate the 𝜌𝑠𝑎𝑡
∗ as a function of solar zenith 𝜃𝑜, sensor zenith 𝜃, 
relative azimuth angle Δ𝜙, 𝜌𝑠 and AOD (varied from 0-5). LUTs corresponding to 𝐴𝑂𝐷=
0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2, 3.0, 5.0 for each spectral band are generated and saved. Each LUT 
contains calculated path reflectance for ten 𝜃𝑜 and 𝜃  values ranging from 0.0 to 72.0 with an 
interval of 6.0 degrees and for sixteen Δ𝜙 values ranging from 0.0 to 180.0 with an interval of 
12 degrees. For RT simulation several ready-to-use codes are freely available, however, in the 
current version of the algorithm, the discrete ordinate method is used for which CDISORT code 
is customized as per the need.

4.3.5 Aerosol inversion 
The radiance data for two blue channels (443 and 490 nm in the case of OCM-2) are then 
compared with modelled radiance. A maximum likelihood method is used to match the 
appropriate values of aerosol optical thickness at 550nm and mixing ratio to the measured 
radiance. For estimating the best solution, first AOD solutions using different aerosol models 
(represented by 12 values of fine mode fraction ranging from -0.1 to 1.1) is estimated by 
finding the perfect match between modelled and observed radiance in band-3 (490 nm), 
secondly among these best AOD solutions one is chosen as the final solution by comparing 
modelled and measured radiance in band-2 (443nm). The technique thus derived gives a 
procedure, which is performed on each cloud-free land pixel, giving one of the finest daily 
aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm and fine mode fraction. Mathematically for each pixel, 
a set of AOD and fine mode fraction is found for which the equations (13) and (14) are 
satisfied.

6.2 Methods of validation 
6.2.1 AERONET data for validation 
Ground-based observations can be made using AERONET (Holben et al., 1998), and any of the 
several miscellaneous techniques, including the diffuse/direct method and polarization 
measurements. AERONEt (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a network of ground-based sun 
photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben of Code 923 of the NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS. The sun-photometers measure the spectral 
aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In India 4 AERONET sites namely Jaipur, Kanpur, 
Gandhi College, and Amity University Noida; in Bangladesh 2 sites namely Bhola and Dhaka 
University; in Pakistan Lahore and Karachi, and few sites in Nepal and Myanmar are providing 
systematic in-situ AOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of 
OCM-2 derived AODs after proper co-location in space and time.  
For co-location of AERONET data with OCM-2 AOD retrievals, the in-situ AOD measurements 
will be averaged in a ±30 minute window centered at the time of OCM-2 AOD retrievals. It is 
to be noted that different AERONET stations may have a different temporal resolution of the 
in-situ measurement, therefore, along with overall validation, the variation in validation 
results when using in-situ data at different temporal resolution will also be studied. 
6.2.2 Handheld sun photometer validation 
Many of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to 
provide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. Ongoing and Past data 
from such campaigns will be sued for validation. 
6.2.3 Satellite-based Inter-comparisons 
OCM-2 derived AOD may be validated by comparing them with aerosol optical depths derived 
by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS/VIIRS. The basic inter-comparison technique 
involves three steps: 1) Identification of locations where both sensors fly over at nearly the 
same time; 2) Extraction of data for storage in an inter-comparison archive; 3) Analysis of the 
differences between the measurements. 
6.3 Provisional validation 
6.3.1 Derived AOD maps 
Figures 6, 7, and 8 display the ability of the developed aerosol product to capture different 
sources of aerosols such as small to large-scale forest fires, dust storms, and anthropogenic 
activities over different parts of India. Due to high-resolution data (figure 6) it is evident that 
22 
 
the spatial distribution of aerosol over megacities such as Delhi can be monitored using the 
OCM-2 AOD product. The availability of high-resolution spatial distribution of aerosol from 
space over megacities will play a major role in developing a product such as ground particulate 
matter (PM2.5 and PM10) maps at a large scale, which will be helpful in monitoring of air-
quality and developing mitigation techniques in metropolitan cities. 
In figure 8, the AOD map, fine mode fraction map, and AOD histogram are shown for data 
acquired by OCM-2 over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January 
2021. The particle size distribution function from AERONET data at Bhola station, Bangladesh 
is also shown in figure 8 for the same date. A very thick layer of aerosol (heavy air pollution, 
AOD>1.0) over IGP is observed. The AERONET stations located at Dhaka University and Bhola, 
Bangladesh show very high AOD values of 1.5 and 1.25, respectively. OCM-2 AOD retrieval is 
consistent with ground observations. A fine mode fraction map shows high fine aerosols in 
the entire IGP, while relatively coarser-sized particles in central India are observed. It is well 
known that during winter’s high anthropogenic pollution associated with the biomass/biofuel 
combustion process occurs over IGP giving rise to fine aerosols. The dominance of fine mode 
aerosol is also verified by size distribution observations at AERONET stations Dhaka University 
and Bhola.  
6.3.2 Validation results with AERONET data 
As described previously the retrieved products must look reasonable, and must be evaluated 
about ground-truth data. The test data includes the entire 2016 data i.e., almost around 1092 
L1B datasets were processed to generate the aerosol product. Out of these 180 individual 
granules corresponding to path-9, row-13 (during the entire year of 2016) enclosing four 
AERONET stations namely Kanpur, Jaipur, Gual Pahari (India), and Karachi (Pakistan) are used 
for validation with ground truth.   Among these, 3 stations, are interior urban centers and 
mainly affected by anthropogenic sources of aerosols. Over Karachi, being a coastal city, the 
aerosols are also affected by marine sources (sea salt) in addition to anthropogenic sources. 
The results are shown in figure 9. A very good correlation, of around 0.8 is observed. About 
63% to 80% of AOD retrievals are within the error envelope (EE) of 20%. The results show that 
the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive towards aerosol retrieval using VNIR observation 
from the OCM-2 sensor.   A slight deviation of the slope of the regression line may be due to 
several reasons but most probably it is due to calibration error, deviation of aerosol optical 
properties used for inversion, and/or due to uncertainty in surface characterization in the 
visible channel. These factors need to be improved in future versions.

7.0 Technical issues (Limitations etc.) 
 
The aerosol retrieval may fail at very bright surfaces due to physical limitations or due to the 
saturation of data. For very bright surfaces after a certain value of aerosol optical depth, the 
model radiance becomes highly inaccurate.  
 
In the current version of the algorithm, the fine mode fraction values are used at discrete 
levels therefore fine mode maps may show pixelated appearance.  
 
Validation of the fine mode fraction is difficult as no in-situ observations are available, 
however, in the future fine mode AOD (FAOD) may be correlated with AERONET inverted 
FAOD values. 
 
Using OCM-2 channels it is not possible to identify snowy pixels, therefore though snow pixels 
are expected to be masked as cloudy pixels due to high reflectance but still partially snow 
contaminated or less reflecting snow pixels may so unexpected AOD retrieved values. In 
26 
 
future versions, AWIFS based snow climatology can be used for the identification of snowy 
pixels. 
 
For AOD retrievals the OCM-2 radiance image is down-sampled by the average filter of 3 x 3-
pixel size to improve the signal-to-noise ratio required for AOD retrieval. If retrieval is 
performed at the original resolution the uncertainty may reach above the targeted 
uncertainty of <20%.  
 
It is to be noted the aerosol retrieval is very sensitive to the radiance calibration as well as to 
surface reflectance. An error of 1% sensor measured reflectance or in surface reflectance may 
lead to an uncertainty of 10% in AOD retrievals.  
 
8.0 Future scope 
 
The current algorithm will be extended to derive AOD at other spectral wavelengths also. 
 
Cloud contamination in AOD retrievals at the edges of the clouds may be improved by 
developing a better cloud mask based on spectral analysis. 
 
In the current version of the algorithm, the vegetation index is used to know the surface type 
for surface characterization from visible bands; however, pseudo-albedo may also be a 
potential variable for the same purpose.  
 
 A similar algorithm can be adapted for OCM-3 on-board upcoming OceanSat-3.  
 
Knowing AOD, the aerosol correction on level-1 data can be performed for generating surface 
reflectance and various land products such as surface NDVI.  
 
Since OCM-2 AOD retrieval is at a very high spatial resolution of 0.7 km, therefore these can 
be used for atmospheric correction of AWIFS data which will make AWIFS data more useful 
for agriculture and other land-use applications. 
 
In the current version, the aerosol model is taken from the work done by Levy et al, 2007 
about one decade ago based on global in-situ data from AERONET. However, there is a need 
for reanalysis/updating of aerosol types over different parts of the world, especially over 
countries like India with complex atmosphere. This will improve the aerosol retrieval accuracy 
and will also help in establishing the fine-mode fraction as a quantitative indicator instead of 
the qualitative indicator for anthropogenic aerosol sources. 
 
This product is expected to cater inputs for radiative effects of aerosols and air-quality 
monitoring. 
 
9.0 Discussion 
In the present document, we introduced a new algorithm for deriving aerosol properties over land 
from OCM-2 Level 1B spectral radiance. The beta version of the OCM-2 aerosol product generated 
using this algorithm is operational from 17 December 2020. Unlike other algorithms, this method 
does not need SWIR channel observation, moreover, it does not assume near Infrared channels 
27 
 
transparent to aerosols. In fact, in addition to visible channels, it uses aerosol information 
contained in near Infrared channels also. The OCM-2 aerosol algorithm is tested subjectively as 
well as on several test datasets. The results are evaluated at co-located AERONET sites. In its 
provisional validation, OCM-2 AOD retrievals perform well. On average nearly 70% of AOD 
retrievals found within an uncertainty envelope of 20% with a correlation coefficient r = 0.83. 
Retrievals of fine mode fraction are found to agree with a general understanding of aerosol 
sources in India and to some extent have been seen correlated with an AERONET size distribution, 
but quantitatively have not been validated and therefore results should not be considered to be 
quantitative. We note that the validation of fine mode AOD will be done in near future, which will 
be a product that can be related to the anthropogenic contribution to the total aerosol optical 
depth. The provisional validation suggests that the operational beta version retrieval is capable of 
deriving AOD over land within expected uncertainty. However, it is necessary to perform extensive 
validation exercises including more ground truth sites with more OCM-2 data. 
As already discussed in the introductory section the primary objective of developing this algorithm 
is intended to cater inputs for radiative and air-quality studies over the Indian landmass. However, 
with this aerosol product, OCM-2 data utilization can be extended to other land applications also, 
which was to date limited to ocean Colour applications only. Just as part of this discussion and to 
appreciate the utility of OCM aerosol product for other land applications, we have shown OCM-2 
NDVI product derived with and without aerosol correction in figure 9. The drastic improvement 
apparent in NDVI establishes the possible utility of this AOD product in many other land 
applications in addition to radiative and air-quality related studies. 
 
Figure 10. Drastic improvement in OCM-2 derived NDVI after correction for aerosol is 
apparent in the images shown.
