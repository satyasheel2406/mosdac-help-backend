1 -About 

Space Applications Centre (SAC) is an ISRO Centre located at Ahmedabad, dealing with a wide variety of themes from satellite payload development, 
operational data reception and processing to societal applications. SAC is responsible for the development, realization and qualification of communication, 
navigation, earth observation and planetary payloads and related data processing and ground systems in the areas of communications, broadcasting,
remote sensing and disaster monitoring / mitigation. Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) is a Data Centre
of Space Applications Centre (SAC) and has facility for satellite data reception, processing, analysis and dissemination. 
MOSDAC is operationally supplying earth observation data from Indian meteorology and oceanography satellites,
to cater to national and international research requirements.

2 -Objectives of MOSDAC : 

The Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) primarily aims to collect, archive, and disseminate meteorological and oceanographic satellite data for research and operational applications. MOSDAC serves as a central hub for this data, supporting various applications like weather forecasting, cyclone prediction, and ocean state monitoring. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of MOSDAC's objectives:

Data Archival and Dissemination:
MOSDAC serves as a repository for satellite data related to meteorology and oceanography, making it accessible to researchers, scientists, and other users. 

Supporting Operational Applications:
The data provided by MOSDAC is crucial for various operational applications, including weather forecasting, cyclone prediction, and monitoring of ocean conditions. 

Enhancing Scientific Research:
MOSDAC facilitates research in atmospheric and oceanic sciences by providing access to high-quality satellite data. 

Promoting New Applications:
By making data available, MOSDAC encourages the development of new applications in areas like fisheries, coastal zone management, and climate change studies. 

Ensuring Data Continuity:
MOSDAC plays a vital role in ensuring the continuity of data from key satellite missions like Oceansat and INSAT, which are essential for long-term monitoring and analysis. 
Supporting National and International Requirements:
MOSDAC caters to both national and international research needs by providing access to a wide range of satellite data. 

Developing Algorithms and Products:
MOSDAC is involved in developing and improving algorithms for retrieving geophysical parameters from satellite data, such as wind vectors and sea surface temperature.
