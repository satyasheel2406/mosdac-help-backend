Greetings, 
 
We are pleased to announce the launch of Single Sign On (SSO) functionality on MOSDAC site. SSO will 
enable users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and datasets by using just one set of login 
credentials. We are also happy to announce the release of new User Order Processing System (UOPS) on 
our MOSDAC site. New UOPS is user friendly and has features like Band extraction, Time based selection, 
Region of interest based ordering and much more.  
 
We would like you to explore the New UOPS and send your feedback / suggestions at 
admin@mosdac.gov.in. 
 
In order to have a smooth transition for the users, we plan to continue the old User ordering System for 
a period of one month.  
 
Links to access the ordering system are as follows:

Looking forward for your cooperation. 
 
Be Safe Be Healthy !!
