Satellite meteorology refers to the study of the 
earth’s atmosphere using data collected by remote 
sensing instruments flown on board artificial satellites 
orbiting the earth. For studying earth’s atmosphere 
and predicting its future, precise measurements of 
the atmospheric parameters are important. Unlike 
the in-situ instruments, remote sensing instruments 
obtain information of the meteorological parameters 
without coming in to physical contact. Artificial 
satellites equipped with remote sensing instruments 
monitor the state of the atmosphere continuously 
from 
space. 
These 
are 
called 
weather 
or 
meteorological satellites. They are generally launched 
in to geostationary and polar orbits. 
Geostationary meteorological satellites orbit the 
earth at an altitude of 36,000 km and remain 
stationary with respect to the rotating earth. It can 
continuously monitor the entire hemisphere below 
it. The United States (GOES Series), Japan 
(Himawari), European Union (Meteosat series), India 
(INSAT Series) and China (Fengyn series) operate 
geostationary meteorological satellites. They provide 
meteorological data with high temporal resolution. 
Polar meteorological satellites orbit the earth at low 
earth orbits (about 850 km) and circles from pole to 
pole. The United States (NOAA series), Europe 
(Metop Series), Russia (Meteor/RESURS series), India 
and China operate meteorological satellites in polar 
orbit. They provide meteorological data with better 
spatial resolution. 
 
Training 
on 
Satellite 
Meteorology 
Satellite Meteorology and Oceanography Research 
and Training (SMART) programme of Space 
Applications Centre, Ahmedabad is organising a 
training 
programme 
on 
‘Basics 
of 
Satellite 
Meteorology’. This training programme aims to 
generate awareness about satellite meteorology 
among students, researchers and faculty members 
who are interested to start a carrier in this field. This 
training programme will cover basic concepts of 
satellite meteorology, satellite image interpretation, 
different meteorological parameters provided by 
satellites, basic concepts of parameter retrieval, 
validation methodologies, MOSDAC satellite data 
portal and potential meteorological applications of 
satellite data.

familiarisation with satellite meteorological data in the 
afternoon.  Participants will be provided subsidised 
paid accommodation at SAC guest house on twin 
sharing basis. No fee will be charged for attending the 
training. No TA/DA will be provided for attending the 
training. Participation certificates will be provided 
after the completion of training. Only selected

Cyclone Ockhi  as viewed by INSAT-3D on 4 Dec. 2017 
 
 
 
 
 
Training on  
Basics of Satellite Meteorology 
Cyclone Ockhi originated as a depression off southeast coast 
of Srilanka, touched Kanyakumari and finally crossed Gujarat 
coast on 05 December 2017. Many died and many fishermen 
from Tamilnadu and Kerala could not be traced. It is one of 
the costliest cyclone in Indian Ocean in recent history.
