Introduction 
Indian Space Research Organisation 
(ISRO) 
has 
launched 
dedicated 
meteorological 
and 
oceanographic 
satellites viz., INSAT series, Kalpana-1, 
Megha-Tropiques, Oceansat-1 & 2, 
RISAT-1 and SARAL. In future, ISRO 
has planned to launch INSAT-3DR, 
Scatsat, GISAT and a few more 
satellites 
for 
meteorological 
and 
oceanographic studies. Data collected 
by these satellites are archived and 
disseminated through a data portal 
‘Meteorological and Oceanographic 
Satellite 
Data 
Archival 
Centre’ 
(MOSDAC) designed and developed by 
Space Applications Centre (SAC), 
Ahmedabad.  
 
Objective 
SMART is ISRO’s initiative to support 
students, academics and researchers 
across the country to pursue research in 
the 
field 
of 
Meteorology 
and 
Oceanography 
using satellite data 
archived at MOSDAC and other related 
datasets. SMART is 
managed by 
MOSDAC Research and Training 
Division (MRTD), MOSDAC Research 
Group, SAC 
 
SMART provides following support for 
students, academics and researchers:  
i. Familiarisation to MOSDAC data 
ii. Data analytics and advanced 
visualization 
iii. State-of-the-art 
computer 
facilities and 
iv. Research guidance 
 
 
 
 
Two outreach initiatives namely (i) 
Research Initiative and (ii) Training 
Initiative are planned as part of SMART 
to accomplish its objective.  
 
I. Research Initiative 
Research initiative of SMART offers 
three programmes to cater the needs of 
students, academics and researchers 
across the country namely: 
 
(i) Research Initiation Programme 
(IP)  
This programme is designed to initiate 
research aptitude among students, 
academics and researchers in the field 
of 
Satellite 
Meteorology 
and 
Oceanography. Post-graduate students 
of Meteorology, Oceanography and 
related fields, intending to do their final 
year/semester 
project, 
young 
researchers and academics may apply 
for this programme. They will be 
introduced to Satellite Meteorology and 
Oceanography, 
provided 
research 
guidance and support to carry out 
research for three to nine months.  
 
 (ii) Advance Research Programme 
(ARP) 
In this programme, researchers and 
academics attached with institutes and 
universities across the country will be 
supported to carry out advance research 
in their research topic using MOSDAC 
data for about three to six months. They 
will be introduced to advanced satellite 
data retrieval techniques, calibration/ 
validation methods and latest results on 
satellite data applications

(iii) Data Exploration Programme 
(DEP) 
It 
is 
an 
inter-disciplinary 
data 
exploratory programme on Satellite 
Meteorology and Oceanography. It is 
open 
for 
undergraduate 
students, 
academics 
and 
researchers 
of 
recognized universities and research 
institutions with innovative ideas to use 
satellite 
data 
in 
Meteorology, 
Oceanography, Data mining and Image 
processing. They will be provided 
research guidance, computational and 
data support to carry out research for 
one to three months.  
 
II. Training Initiative 
Under SMART, satellite data training 
programmes 
will 
be 
organised 
periodically to popularise MOSDAC 
data among students, academics and 
researchers. It is generally a short 
duration 
(three 
to 
five 
days) 
programme, planned about 2-3 times a 
year. About 15 participants will be 
admitted 
to 
this 
programme. 
Familiarization of MOSDAC data, 
hands-on sessions on data handling and 
pre- and post-satellite launch trainings 
will be part of this training initiative.  
Calendar of SMART training initiative 
will be announced well in advance. 
 
Facilities Offered 
A dedicated research and training lab 
equipped 
with 
state-of-the-art 
workstations, 
display 
systems, 
MOSDAC data and storage facility are 
established in SAC as part of SMART. 
Students, academics and researchers 
attending the research and training 
programmes will be allowed to use 
these facilities. Also they will be 
permitted to use the SAC canteen 
facility during their stay at SAC. 
 
Call for Participation  
Applications are invited from students, 
academics and researchers for SMART 
research initiative programmes viz., IP, 
ARP and DEP. Interested may fill-in the 
application form provided at the 
SMART website and forward it to the 
Head, MRTD, SAC through their 
respective Head of the Department/ 
Institution. Applications are accepted 
throughout the year. Patent, copyright, 
IPR arising from the work done at SAC 
should be made jointly with SAC.
