2. Introduction 
India successfully launched its advanced meteorological satellite INSAT-3DR on 26th September 
2016 in the geostationary orbit at 74E. The inheritance of this satellite has come from INSAT-3D 
satellite. Meteorological payloads onboard INSAT-3DR are a 6 channel Imager and a 19 channel 
Sounder mainly for atmospheric profiles, cyclone and monsoon monitoring, cloud motion vectors 
winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation monitoring, snow cover detection, 
mesoscale studies etc. Apart from a 19 channel Sounder in INSAT-3D/3DR, the Imager has a split-
window (TIR1/2), mid-IR (MIR) window, and shortwave IR (SWIR) channels in additions to 
earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana VHRR. Details of the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels are given in 
Table-1. The spectral response functions (SRF) of TIR1 &2, MIR and WV bands of INSAT-3D 
are shown in figure (1) along with brightness temperature spectra of Infrared Atmospheric 
Sounding Interferometer (IASI) for a standard tropical atmosphere.

Sea surface temperature is derived from the split thermal window channels (10.3-11.2m, 11.5 
12.5m) during daytime and using additional midwave-IR window channel (3.8 4.0 m) during 
nighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of the SST retrieval from IR 
observations is the atmospheric correction. Especially over tropics, this atmospheric correction is 
dominated by the high variability in vertical distribution of the intervening atmospheric water 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018

vapor. This correction is determined through suitable characterization of tropical atmosphere in 
the radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D/3DR channels 
and then generating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have 
been given in section 3.1. 

2.1 Overview and background 
This algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the current operational algorithm for 
the retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels data. While effort 
has been made to make this document as complete as possible, it should be recognized that 
algorithm development is an evolving process. This document (V1.1) is a description of the revised 
algorithm for INSAT-3D/3DR sea surface temperature estimation as it currently exists, and is 
being delivered for inclusion in the INSAT-3D/3DR processing scheme. 
Current research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the processes at 
the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic 
revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear incomplete in places as research 
continues to improve our understanding of the processes at work. Subsequent revisions of the 
document will reflect new knowledge and, it is hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here.

3. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
3.1 Overview 
3.1.1 Theoretical Background 
Radiance from Earths terrestrial emission peaks at around 10 m and it has minimum attenuation 
by atmospheric gases. Hence in order to measure earths surface temperature, space borne sensors 
are designed around this band (8-12m). Still this band is not completely transparent. Atmospheric 
water vapour and CO2 are the major constituents that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of 
the atmosphere in this wavelength band. Since CO2 is a uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be 
taken care, but water vapour being highly variable in space and time needs additional information 
on total water content in the atmosphere (directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea surface 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018

temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires atmospheric 
correction arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This correction is more in 
tropics during summer due to higher amount of atmospheric moisture loading (Barton 1983, 
Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). The 
radiative transfer simulation studies, carried out using diverse training profiles set, have shown 
that with proper characterization of water vapour in the atmosphere, a suitable algorithm can be 
developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal window and mid IR thermal 
channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K (Fig.2). The simplest of such algorithms 
assume that, for small cumulative amounts of water vapour, the atmosphere is sufficiently optically 
thin that the difference between the measured temperature in any band and the true surface 
temperature can be parameterized as a simple function of the difference between the measured 
temperatures in two bands with different atmospheric transmissions. 
Linear algorithms like Multi Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) are based on a formula 
of the following form for the surface temperature Ts. 

= + + () 
 (1) 

where, the Tis are the brightness temperatures in various bands for a given location and , and 
 give the parametrized correction (Deschamps and Phulpin 1980, Llewellyn-Jones et al., 1984), 
or can be derived empirically from good composite sets of surface and satellite observations 
(Prabhakara, et al., 1974). 
Although Eq. (1) is easy to implement, it does not permit correction for changes in air mass due to 
scan-angle. Llewellyn-Jones et al., (1984) develop a table from numerical simulations which 
permits modification of Eq. (1) into a form: 

= + + () + (1) (2) 

where, is the satellite zenith angle and is an additional scan angle coefficient. This approach 
reduces the errors at large scan angles for moist atmospheres by more than 1K. This form, however, 
while improving the error behavior at large scan angles, does not adequately control the residual 
behavior at high temperatures. 
A further generalization of this approach is to posit a non-linear structure for the SST estimator. 
For that a NLSST (non-linear SST) atmospheric equation uses the form: 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 

7 

= 0 + 11 + 2(1 2) + 3(1 2). (1 2) + 4(1). (1 2) (3) 

where, SST is the satellite derived SST estimate, T1 and T2 are the brightness temperatures of 
INSAT-3DR thermal channels (TIR-1 and TIR-2). a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are the retrieval coefficients 
estimated from the regression analysis using collocated simulated brightness temperatures and 
SST. The above equation (3) is currently operational at MOSDAC and IMD, Delhi. 
The validation results of operational SST with in-situ and MODIS SST products has been 
presented in science team meeting of Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature 
(GHRSST) held at China during 05-09 June, 2017. In the meeting the Science Team members 
suggested to drop the square term of the difference between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 & 
TIR-2, being used for correcting the atmospheric water vapour contamination. It was point out that 
if there is large noise in thermal channels, the square of their difference may result in large errors 
in SST, which was also observed on many occasions in the operational products. Therefore, based 
on the recommendations from GHRSST Science Team and subsequent validation analysis of the 
operational SST products, the SST retrieval algorithm has been modified to address this issue of 
large errors in SST due to non-linear WV correction term. 
The revised algorithm follows Walton et al. (1998) for SST retrieval which has the following form: 
Day-time: 

= 0 + 11 + 2(sec 1) + 3. (1 2) + 4(1). (1 2) (4) 
Night-time: 

= 0 + 13 + 2(sec 1) + 3. (1 2) + 4(1). (1 2) (5) 
where, T3 is the brightness temperature of MIR channel. Tsfc is the a priori estimate of SST that can 
be taken from the climatology or from the forecast of the numerical weather prediction models. 
All other variables are same as in equation (3). The multiplication factor Tsfc is used to scale the 
correction factor due to atmospheric water vapor. We have also tried to experiment with the 
brightness temperature of TIR1 as a multiplying factor, which yields very similar result. However, 
in order to avoid occasional large noise in the TIR1 BT we retain Tsfc as the multiplying factor as 
in the original algorithm proposed by Walton et al. (1998). 

3.1.2 Radiative Transfer Model 
Since frequency bands and their spectral response functions of INSAT-3DR and INSAT-3D are 
almost similar, the transmission coefficients file of INSAT-3D required to simulate brightness 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 

8 

temperatures through PFAAST radiative transfer (RT) model can be used for simulating INSAT-
3DR brightness temperatures. Therefore, we have simulated the brightness temperatures 
corresponding to INSAT-3DR thermal and mid-IR channels through PFAAST RT model. The 
atmospheric profiles and required surface variables has been taken from ECMWF diverse data set. 
The simulations have been performed for the clear atmospheres over oceanic region spanning from 
0E 130E and 60S 60N only, and for satellite zenith angle from 0 to 60 degrees. 

3.1.3 Cloud detection 
In the present algorithm, the cloudy pixels are flagged using INSAT-3DR level-2 cloud mask 
product. In absence of the INSAT-3DR cloud mask product the cloudy pixels are detected through 
cloud mask routine based on threshold and spatial coherence techniques in visible, MIR and 
thermal bands. Threshold technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness 
temperature in thermal band (TIR-1) is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in 
decreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is based on the 
assumption that SST is homogeneous in smaller spatial domain and sufficiently warmer than 
clouds; thus clouds can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value 
or larger standard deviation. In addition to above the following thresholds criteria as described in 
ATBD of MODIS (Ackerman et al., 2006) cloud mask product have also been used. 
During day time the reflection in MIR channels dominates over emission; therefore, in general 
MIR BT can be higher than TIR-1 BT by up to ~6K for clear-sky. However, for MIR channel the 
reflection coefficient is higher for cloud top than earths surface. Hence the difference of TIR1 and 
MIR BTs becomes more negative for cloudy sky. The visible reflectance is very high for clouds 
as compared to earths surface. Hence, higher visible albedo (>5 %) or reflectance corresponds to 
cloudy sky. During day-time (solar zenith angle < 80 degree) the following threshold criterion has 
been used to detect cloudy pixels: 
1 3 < 6.0 & ( > 70 > 5) 
where, T1 and T3 are the brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and MIR channels of INSAT-3D/3DR, 
respectively. 
During night there is no solar reflection at MIR wavelength hence satellite measures only emitted 
radiation. Since cloud emissivity is lower for MIR as compared to TIR-1 wavelength, the 
brightness temperature corresponding to MIR will be smaller than that of TIR-1 BT for cloudy 
pixels. Hence, during night-time (solar zenith angle >= 80 degree) the following threshold is used 
to mask the cloudy pixels:

SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. 

3.1.4 Error Analysis 
A simulation based sensitivity study of noise in TIR-1 & TIR-2 channels BTs on the SST retrieval 
has been carried out to analyze the errors in the retrieved SST. The simulations have been 
performed through PFAAST radiative transfer model using atmospheric profiles from ECMWF 
diverse training dataset for INSAT-3D spectral response functions. The following figure (2) is 
showing the impact of noise in both the channels on the errors in the retrieved SST. From the figure 
it can be clearly pointed out that if both the channels have uncertainty of 0.1K, the theoretical error 
in retrieved SST would be ~ 0.7K. If uncertainty in both the channels is ~0.05K the minimum 
possible error in the retrieved SST would be 0~.55K. 

Fig. 2: Sensitivity of total noise in the retrieval of SST from INSAT-3D Imager 

It can also be inferred from the figure (2) that using split-window channels the best possible SST 
accuracy of 0.5K could be achieved. For getting better than 0.5K accuracy, one should opt other 
atmospheric WV correction techniques as used in ATSR mission which gives approximately 0.3K 
(Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1988; Barton, et al., 1993) errors in retrieved SST. In ATSR dual-
view configuration has been used to correct the atmospheric WV. The Superiority of the dual-view 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 

10 

algorithm over single-view split-window algorithm lies in the fact that use of the cleaner window 
for atmospheric correction using second view with larger path-length reduces the uncertainty that 
arises in the split window algorithm due to larger uncertainties in the attenuation in the second 
split-window channel due to highly variable atmospheric water vapor.

3.3 Operational Implementation 
The implementation is done in the following steps: 
Step-1. Reading of the grey counts, geolocation, satellite and solar zenith angles. 
Step-2. Determine brightness temperatures from grey counts using the lookup table. 
Step-3. Mask the land pixels using land/sea mask. 
Step-4. Processing for discrimination between brightness temperatures from cloud free sea surface 
and those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 3.1.3. 
Step-5. Computation of SST 
For cloud-free pixels, SST is computed as 
= 0 + 11 + 2(1) + 3. (1 2) + 4(1). (1 2) 

(a0= 15.3364, a1= 0.9535, a2=- 0.8215, a3= 0.0072, a4=0.5144 for INSAT-3DR) 
(a0= 15.8150, a1= 0.9519, a2=- 0.8544, a3= 0.0075, a4=0.5340 for INSAT-3D) 
where, as and bs are the retrieval coefficients, T1, T2 and T3 are the brightness temperatures of 
TIR-1, TIR-2. Tsfc has been taken from the daily SST climatology. 
Step-6. Quality control/Editing of derived SST 
Only those SST values will be retained for which the following condition holds:

where, is the standard deviation of the daily climatological SST and SSTclim is the daily value of 
climatological SST.

3.5 Validation 
The extensive validation of the derived SST will be done using all the available data from buoys, 
special cruise by research vessels and available similar products from various satellite missions. 

3.5.1 Initial validation 
Preliminary validation of SST retrieved through the proposed algorithm for both INSAT-3D & 
3DR with concurrent in-situ as well as MODIS/Aqua SST been performed for 11-18 December, 
2017. Comparison of operational products have also been performed with same in-situ SST data 
for the same period. We have taken 0.040 spatial resolution and 15 minutes temporal resolution 
for collocation. The daily products have also been compared with GHRSST (Group for High 
Resolution SST) daily SST products for the same period. 

3.5.1.1 Comparison with in-situ: 
The in situ records acquired from In-situ quality monitor (Iquam) portal hosted by National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are first temporally matched-up against the 
INSAT-3D/3DR extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the 
two data sources, the absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the 
time at which that location is viewed by the INSAT-3D/3DR (i.e., the matchup time window) is 
restricted to a maximum of 15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the stipulated time 
window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal matchup subsequently have to 
pass a spatial test. 
The figures 4(a) and 4(b) are showing the scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST retrieved through new 
and operational algorithm with respect to concurrent in-situ SST measurements while figures 5(a) 
and 5(b) are showing the same for INSAT-3DR SST.

From above figures (4) and (5), it can be seen that the spread is less in new SST as compared to 
operational SST when compared with same in-situ data for both satellites. This clearly indicates 
an improvement in SST when retrieved using proposed algorithm than the operational SST. The 
correlation coefficient also shows an improvement.

3.5.1.2 Comparison with MODIS/Aqua: 
A preliminary comparison of SST retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm for both 
INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with MODIS/Aqua SST for the same period of 
11-18, December 2017. Figures (6-7) are showing the density scatter plot for both the products: 
new as well as operational for both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR sensors.

The quantitative comparison in terms of correlation coefficient, mean difference (bias), the 
standard deviation of the difference (Std) with respect to MODIS SST has also been shown in 
same figures. From the above figures it is clear that both the bias and Std of new SST are less than 
that of operational SST when compared with MODIS. Therefore, SST accuracy is improved when 
retrieved using the proposed algorithm. 

3.5.2.3 Comparison with GHRSST DAILY Products: 
An initial comparison of daily SST products retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm 
for both INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with GHRSST daily SST products for 
the same period of 11-18, December 2017. The comparison has been shown by the spatial plots of 
the differences in both the SST products. The following figures (8) and (9) are showing the spatial 
plots of the differences for INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, respectively for 11th December 2017. 

 (a) 

 (b) 
Fig. 8: Difference of daily INSAT-3D SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New 

It can be clearly seen from the above figures (8) and (9) that except some locations the difference 
between INSAT-3D/3DR SST and GHRSST is within 1K when retrieved through proposed 
algorithm. While the difference between operational SST and GHRSST products is as high as 2.5 
to 3K in case of INSAT-3D and as low as -2.5 to -3K in case of INSAT-3DR. This clearly indicates 
the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the operational one.

3.6 Applications 
There are many potential applications of SST. Among those thermal gradient is one of the most 
important features of the SST which is required to study various mesoscale oceanic processes as 
well as a serves as an indicator of potential fishery zones (PFZ). Thermal gradients from GHRSST 
daily products is shown in figure (10).

The thermal gradients computed from daily products of INSAT-3D/3DR SST retrieved through 
proposed and operational algorithm for 13th December 2017 are shown in the following figures 
(11) and (12). This work has been carried out with our colleagues from oceanic sciences division 
(OSD).

 (b) 
Fig. 12: Thermal gradients from daily INSAT-3DR SST (a) Operational (b) New 
On comparing figures (11) and (12) with figure (10), we can see that for both INSAT-3D & 3DR 
the SST gradients calculated from the daily SST products retrieved through proposed algorithm is 
closer to GHRSST gradients as compared to gradients calculated from SST retrieved through 
operational algorithm. 
The above initial validation exercise confirms the superiority of the proposed algorithm over 
the operational one.

3.7 Technical issues (limitation etc.) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to simulate the 
satellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in radiative transfer model 
simulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST with reliable and concurrent in-
situ data. In the absence of split thermal window channel observations and a channel sensitive to 
intervening atmospheric total water vapour content, the atmospheric correction applied is an 
indirect. The accuracy of this correction will heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model 
reanalysis for total water vapour. Major constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort 
focus in the following areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NET 
for each band, calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-
validation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, and 
timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit instrument NET 
performance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget. 

3.7 Future Scope 
Initially, this proposed algorithm and bias correction would be used to derive SST. Over a period 
of approximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias correction 
and other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should improve the accuracy 
of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also plays a crucial role in 
determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of regression coefficients for SST 
retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy observations data base require nearly 250 buoys 
distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 
years. 
Moreover, the bias correction as mentioned above is based on the simulated brightness 
temperatures using ECMWF analysis profiles and PFAAST RT model. Also, ECMWF analysis 
profiles may also have some biases which can cause the biases in the simulated brightness 
temperatures. Therefore, in future we will refine this bias correction using radiosonde based 
atmospheric profiles. Similarly, RT models also known to have inherent biases. Hence, better RT 
model like OPTRON will also be explored to reduce the RT model biases.
