5 Title Post processing of TERLS DWR data and Volumetric Gridding
6 Abstract The TERLS DWR data has been processed to correct for clutter and velocity folding prior to their application in hydrological and numerical weather prediction models. The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications. This data was prepared under the TDP/R&D project Storm Tracking and Prediction using Doppler Weather Radar

Inland Water Height
Inland Water Height
It is crucial to know how the storage of inland water bodies change over time. Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

Processing Steps
Firstly the waveforms are classified based on their signature, and then these waveforms are retracked with the suitable retracker.
Dedicated inland range correction algorithms are required to account for the atmospheric delays.Detailed information about the processing can be found in (S. Chanderet. al. 2014, A .Dubey et. al. 2014).

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The water level over the inland water bodies can be retrieved using altimeter waveforms data.
The range information is estimated based on the arrival time of the radar pulse.
This range is then corrected for Dry tropospheric correction, wet tropospheric correction, ionospheric correction, and tidal correction, i.e. Load tide, solid earth tide.
Detailed information about the range corrections can be found in the ATBD document (S. Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.
Limitations
Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.).
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)

River Discharge
River Discharge
River heights from satellite altimeters (ENVISAT, Jason-2 and SARAL AltiKa) have been derived at two cross-over points along Godavari River. Subsequently, river height discharge stage relationship between altimetry derived heights and In-situ river discharge has been established. Using this relationship, river discharge database for Godavari River for the period i.e. 2002 - 2015 has been generated.
