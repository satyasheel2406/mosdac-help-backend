Abstract: Investigation of cloud top temperature (CTT) and its diurnal variation is highly reliant 
on high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data, which is lacking over the Indian region. 
An algorithm has been developed for detection of clouds and retrieval of CTT from the geostationary 
satellite INSAT-3D. These retrievals are validated (inter-compared) with collocated in-situ (satellite) 
measurements with specific intent to generate climate-quality data. The cloud detection algorithm 
employs nine di_erent tests, in accordance with solar illumination, satellite angle and surface type 
conditions to generate pixel-resolution cloud mask. Validation of cloud mask with cloud-aerosol 
lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) shows that probability of detection (POD) of cloudy 
(clear) sky is 81% (85%), with 83% hit rate. The algorithm is also implemented on similar channels 
of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides 88% (83%) POD of 
cloudy (clear) sky, with 86% hit rate.

Cloud Top Temperature from INSAT-3D 

1. Abstract 
Investigation of cloud top temperature (CTT) and its diurnal variation is highly reliant on high 
spatial and temporal resolution satellite data, which is lacking over the Indian region. An 
algorithm has been developed for detection of clouds and retrieval of CTT from the 
geostationary satellite INSAT-3D. These retrievals are validated (inter-compared) with 
collocated in-situ (satellite) measurements with specific intent to generate climate-quality data. 
The cloud detection algorithm employs nine different tests, in accordance with solar 
illumination, satellite angle and surface type conditions to generate pixel-resolution cloud mask. 
Validation of cloud mask with cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) shows 
that probability of detection (POD) of cloudy (clear) sky is 81% (85%), with 83% hit rate. The 
algorithm is also implemented on similar channels of moderate resolution imaging 
spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides 88% (83%) POD of cloudy (clear) sky, with 86% 
hit rate. 
2. Introduction 
Cloud cover (CC) is identified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by Global Climate 
Observing System (GCOS). Accurate information of CC and its spatial and temporal variations 
is of paramount importance for climate studies. Indian national geostationary satellite, INSAT-
3D, provides a unique opportunity to observe continuously over Indian subcontinent and 
surrounding regions at 4km spatial and 30mins temporal resolution. The datasets from INSAT 
satellite series are being widely used for studies on evolution and variation of clouds and their 
properties (Gambheer AND Bhat, 2000; Roca and Ramanathan, 2000; Roca et al., 2005). As 
part of National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) program of 
ISRO, a new integrated algorithm was developed for retrieving CC at pixel level (i.e., 4km x 
4km resolution) from the Imager on-board INSAT-3D with specific intent to generate climate 
quality data. Reliability of the retrieved CC was estimated through inter-comparisons with 
collocated observations from ground-based radiosonde and space based active sensor, Cloud-
Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and 
Infrared Pathfinder satellite Observations (CALIPSO). The reported statistics are comparable 

4 

with that of the same product from other satellites over different regions of the globe (Hanna 
2008; Hamann et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019). Since the intention of 
retrieving the CC is to generate climate quality database, it is critical to assess reliability of the 
product in terms of GCOS standards (https://gcos.wmo.int). As per GCOS, CC product is 
recommended to be at 50km spatial and 3hourly temporal resolution with an uncertainty within 
0.05%. 

3. Data and Methodology 
3.1 Data 
Imager onboard the Indian geostationary satellite, INSAT-3D provides observations over the 
Indian region at a temporal interval of 30 minutes (at HH:00 and HH:30) with visible (VIS), 
shortwave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MIR), water vapor (WV) and thermal infrared 
(TIR1 & TIR2) channels (Katti et al., 2006). Specifications of these channels are given in Table 
1. Present study uses level 1C, Asia sector product (ASIA_MER_L1C) from INSAT-3D Imager 
over India and surrounding regions bounded by 44.5E-105.5E and 10S-45.5N with spatial 
resolution of 4km, which is available through the SAC/ISRO web portal, MOSDAC 
(https://www.mosdac.gov.in). The present algorithm for retrieving CC makes use of VIS, MIR, 
WV, TIR1 and TIR2 channels. Spatial resolutions of VIS and WV channels are 1km and 8km 
respectively, whereas those of MIR and TIR channels are 4km. In order to maintain uniformity, 
measurements from VIS and WV channels are also provided at 4km spatial resolution to match 
with that of MIR and TIR channels.

3.2 Methodology 
As a part of the NICES program of ISRO, an integrated algorithm is developed for identification 
of clouds from INSAT-3D Imager. Figure 1 depicts comprehensive flow chart of the developed 
algorithm.

(Detailed flow charts and descriptions of methodology are available in Lima et al., Remote 
Sensing, 11, 2811, doi: 10.3390/rs11232811, 2019). 

3.3 Retrieval of Cloud Cover (CC) 
CC is retrieved from INSAT-3D Imager at 4km (CC4km) spatial resolutions. Detailed 
information on CC4km retrieval is available in Lima et al., 2019 and Lima et al., 2020; however, 
it is briefly described here (as shown in Figure 1). The detection scheme contains a series of 
hierarchical decision tree tests, which exploit differences in spectral signatures of clouds and 

6 

underlying surfaces. Each pixel undergoes a subroutine that provides information of surface type 
(ocean and land) and solar illumination conditions (day, night, twilight and sunglint). Solar 
elevation angle (_Sun) is used to describe solar illumination conditions; where it is considered 
as day time when _Sun > 10, night when _Sun = 0 and twilight when 0 < _Sun < 10. This 
classification is critical in defining proper thresholds for cloud detection, especially over the 
Indian region where surface characteristics are highly heterogeneous in nature with di_erent geo-
spatial features. The cloud detection algorithm involves three set of tests: a primary test (for all 
types of surfaces and solar illumination conditions), a combination of four (three) secondary tests 
during day/twilight (night) and a combination of two tests for identifying STC clouds. Successful 
performance of this cloud detection algorithm relies on the selection of proper thresholds for 
various spectral tests. The threshold values, which better suit to local atmospheric and surface 
conditions, used in this study are either generated or adopted from previous studies. The primary 
test uses different criteria for the thresholds over land and ocean and is, in general, capable of 
identifying most of the cloud pixels with very high confidence. Secondary tests are applied only 
on those pixels, which are not identified as cloudy by the primary test. In the secondary test, a 
pixel is considered as cloudy if it satisfies at least three (two) out of four (three) tests during day 
time/twilight (night time) conditions. Though primary and secondary tests are sufficient enough 
to identify most of the clouds, these tests are observed to fall short in detecting STC clouds due 
to high transparency at visible and IR wavelengths. Hence, the present algorithm uses additional 
two tests for detecting STC clouds from the remaining pixels.Cloud pixels, identified through the 
cloud detection scheme, are categorized into four classes; high level opaque clouds (HLO), low 
level opaque clouds (LLO), semi-transparent cirrus clouds (STC) and partial clouds (PC) and are 
then subjected to CTT retrieval accordingly. Further details can be found in published papers 
Lima et al., 2019 and Lima et al., 2020. Figure 2 depicts cloud mask retrieved from the INSAT-
3D Imager, by employing the present algorithm.

respectively (Figures are from Lima et al., Remote Sensing, 11, 2811, doi: 10.3390/rs11232811, 
2019). 

4. Validation of products 
In order to provide weather and climate researchers more condence on the products, quality of 
retrieved cloud cover (CC) is assessed through validation and inter-comparison using in-situ and 
other satellite measurements. 

4.1 Validation of INSAT-3D retrieved CC with CALIPSO and MODIS: 
In order to ensure accurate evaluation of generated cloud mask by implementing the present 
algorithm on INSAT-3D, collocated reference datasets are carefully prepared from CALIOP and 
MODIS. From CALIPSO 5 km cloud layer dataset, clear and cloud pixels for inter-comparison 
are identified by using feature classification flags at different atmospheric layers and their quality 
assessment. Accuracy of clear and cloud features from CALIOP is ensured by considering only 
those pixels with quality assessment (QA) value high (high value of QA is same as the CAD 
score > 70). Due to the multiple averaging resolution scheme adopted in the CALIOP product 
retrieval algorithm, the 5 km layer product includes layers with fundamental horizontal 
averaging distance of 5 km, an intermediate distance of 20 km and a maximum of 80 km. This 
leads to an overlap of features in vertical dimensions in the CALIOP data and such overlapping 

8 

is avoided by considering only pixels with horizontal averaging of 5 km. After segregating 
highly confident clear and cloud pixels at each layer from CALIOP, a binary cloud mask is 
generated in which cloud pixels are those with at least one layer of confident cloud feature and 
clear pixels are those with all layers of clear feature. From the level 2 MODIS cloud product, 
only those pixels, which are classified as either confident clear or cloudy are considered for 
comparison in the present study. However, in order to perform inter-comparisons, collocated 
pixels are identified among INSAT-3D, MODIS and CALIOP by using the nearest neighbour 
approach with a maximum distance of 500 m separation between centers of the pixels, within -30 
min temporal difference. 

4.2 Implementation of INSAT-3D Algorithm on MODIS Channels 
The developed cloud detection algorithm for INSAT-3D is applied on the radiance/reflectance 
data from comparable channels of MODIS. MODIS channels considered here are having central 
wavelengths at 0.645 m, 3.9 m, 6.715 m, 11.03 m and 12.02 m, which are close to the 
VIS, MIR, WV, TIR1 and TIR2 channels of INSAT-3D respectively. Basically, MODIS 
provides reflectance at visible and radiance at remaining channels. In order to implement the 
present cloud detection algorithm on MODIS channels, radiances of all channels except 0.645 
m channel are converted to BT using Plancks equation. Other datasets used in the cloud 
detection algorithm, such as SST climatology and GTOPO30, are re-gridded to the spatial 
resolution of MODIS data. Finally, all tests in the present cloud detection algorithm are applied 
to MODIS channels, as they are implemented on INSAT-3D channels. The cloud mask thus 
generated, by implementing the algorithm on MODIS channels, is validated using reference 
dataset from CALIOP and MODIS.

5. Comparison of Cloud detection scheme 
Comparison of INSAT-3D retrieved cloud mask using the current algorithm is carried out with 
collocated measurements from CALIOP and MODIS. Moreover, the developed cloud detection 
algorithm for INSAT-3D is applied on the radiance from comparable channels of MODIS and 
compared the output against the CALIOP data. Quantitative outcomes of the above analysis are 
presented in the form of statistical scores, namely; hit rate, probability of detection (POD) and 
false alarm rate (FAR). Hit rate is fraction of the correctly detected (in comparison with 
reference data) cloud and clear pixels out of the total number of pixels considered, whereas POD 
is fraction of the cloud/clear pixels detected with respect to the reference (CALIOP or MODIS) 
cloud/clear pixels and FAR is fraction of the falsely identified cloud/clear pixels out of the total 
number of detected cloud/clear pixels. Detailed information on cloud identification is available 
in Lima et al., 2020. 

5.1 Comparison of INSAT-3D Retrieved Cloud Mask with CALIPSO Cloud Data 
INSAT-3D detected cloudy and clear-sky regions agree with the CALIOP retrievals over India 
 and surrounding regions for 83% of the time. As indicated by the POD values, 81% of cloud and 
85% of clear-sky pixels in CALIOP products are detected as cloudy and clear-sky respectively 
by INSAT-3D with the present algorithm. Compared to CALIOP retrievals, 18% (16%) of clear-
sky (cloud) pixels are identified falsely as cloudy (clear-sky) by the present algorithm, as 
indicated by the FAR values. The differences observed are mainly attributed to differences in 
sensor characteristics and sampling foot prints. CALIOP has a small footprint of 70 m diameter 

10 

along its sub-satellite track, where it provides measurements at every 333 m, whereas INSAT-3D 
data used in the study are at a spatial resolution of 4 km x4 km. When an INSAT-3D pixel is 
partially clouded and CALIPSO passed through its cloud free portion, the former detects the 
pixel as partially cloudy and the latter does as clear, hence leading to an uncertainty in 
comparison. In order to examine performance of the current algorithm further, these results are 
compared with the reported comparison results of similar passive sensors with CALIOP 
retrievals.

6. Conclusion 
Satellite-based datasets of geophysical variables are crucial for climate research as they represent 
state of the Earths climate system. These datasets are useful to examine climate and its 
variability as well as to fine tune atmospheric model developments. Climate quality data of CC 
are being generated from INSAT-3D satellite observations. Comparison of CC at pixel level 
(4km x 4km resolution) with MODIS and CALIPSO shows mean hit rate of 83%. The CC 
product currently generated is referred to as Version 2.0 and is disseminated through NICES 
web-portal of ISRO.
