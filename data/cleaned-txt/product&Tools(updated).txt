MOSDAC provides a variety of satellite-derived data products that support meteorological and oceanographic research and operations.

1. Rainfall Products:
MOSDAC provides various rainfall products derived from satellite data, including those from INSAT-3D and Megha-Tropiques missions. These products include rainfall estimates based on algorithms like the Hydro-Estimator Method and the INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm Technique (IMSRA). Additionally, MOSDAC offers near-real-time rainfall information and heavy rainfall alerts, including cloudburst potential alerts for the Western Himalayan region.
Rainfall Estimation Products:

Hydro-Estimator Method:
This method, used with KALPANA-1 VHRR data, generates rainfall estimates over the Indian region. 

INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm Technique (IMSRA):
IMSRA is a key operational algorithm for INSAT-3D, using infrared brightness temperatures and TRMM-PR surface rain rate data to estimate precipitation. 

1-2. GSMap ISRO Rain

The GSMaP_ISRO is a precipitation product that was developed through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Implementation of Agreement (IA) specifically for the Indian subcontinent. It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1X 0.1 on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

20. High Resolution Sea Surface Salinity

The Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Data Access
Science products are available to download with a Single Sign On on MOSDAC. Click Here(https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/HRSSS/) to access the data
Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta).
Data Sources
SMAP Sea Surface Salinity (https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SMAP_JPL_L3_SSS_CAP_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V5(link is external)) Altimetry-derived sea surface currents (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/(link is external)).
Processing Steps
i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km.
ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day.
iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1].

Limitations
This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates.
High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)).
Known problems with data
Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

5. Title: Dynamic downscaling of Satellite Sea Surface Salinity for the Bay of Bengal 
6. Abstract: 
 Lagrangian technique is used for generating high-resolution sea surface salinity fields in the Bay of Bengal. This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available restructured product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against in situ data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically.
