Introduction 

This document is the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Definition (ATBD) for the geophysical 
parameter retrieval from INSAT-3D Imager and Sounder channels data. 

This document contains 17 chapters which are structured as follows: Chapter 1 Describes the 
purpose and scope of the document, provides the sensor specifications of INSAT-3D. 
Chapters 2 describes the preliminary cloud masking algorithm using only 3 IR channels of 4 
km resolution which may be used by some parameter generation. Chapters 3 to 21 contain 
the theoretical basis for the individual algorithms of various geophysical parameters except 
HSCAS and tropical cyclone. Algorithms for tropical cyclone position and intensity 
estimation system and snow analysis system are to be written jointly with IMD because 
derivation of these parameters needs large number of auxillary inputs and operational 
meterological expertise. Discussion is going on with IMD for making these two algorithms. 

The purpose of this document is to describe the scientific algorithms which will be used to 
extract the Meteorological Products from the pre-processed Level 1 image data acquired by 
the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) and 19 channel Sounder onboard INSAT-3D 
satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-
red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering 
the following channels: VIS 0.6m, NIR 1.6m, MWIR 3.9m, WV 6.7m, IR 10.8m, IR 
12.0m. Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the following

INSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection 
during daytime. Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise 
sensitivity are summarized in the Table-2.

Introduction 
The discrimination of cloud from the clear sky is necessary for many geophysical parameter 
retrieval from INSAT data. Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower 
temperature than the underlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window 
threshold approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. However, there are many 
surface conditions when this characterization of clouds is inappropriate, most notably over 
snow and ice. Additionally, some cloud types such as thin cirrus, low stratus at night, and small 
cumulus are difficult to detect because of insufficient contrast with the surface radiance. Cloud 
edges cause further difficulty since the instrument field of view will not always be completely 
cloudy or clear. 
INSAT-3D VHRR will measure radiances in one visible and one SWIR band at 1 km spatial 
resolution, one MIR and two TIR bands at 4 km resolution, and one WV band at 8 km 
resolution. Radiances from 3 IR spectral bands TIR 1 , TIR 2 and MIR (Table 1) which are 
of same resolution of 4km are used in the INSAT cloud mask algorithm to estimate whether a 
given view of the earth surface is unobstructed by clouds. 
This cloud mask parameter will be directly used for the retrieval of the following parameters: 
SST , UTH, Fire and Snow Cover. This will be partially used for retrieval of AOD where 
additional test may be required with the visible data. 

2.2.1 Overview and background 
The INSAT cloud mask algorithm benefits from several previous efforts to characterize global 
cloud cover using satellite observations. These algorithms have been used in global cloud 
climatology over long time periods and thus have overcome some of the difficulties facing the 
INSAT cloud mask algorithm. A wide variety of scientists have discussed the physical basis 
behind each of the spectral tests and applications to satellite or aircraft data are present in a 
variety of publications (Ackerman et al. [1997]. The INSAT cloud mask algorithm builds on 
these past works by combining the different tests into a single unified algorithm. 
Operational GOES products by NESDIS also require cloud detection, an algorithm referred 
to as cloud clearing. In this application, an array of nn contiguous pixels is categorized as 
clear, cloudy or unusable. The clear arrays are subcategorized as truly clear and clear/cloudy.

In an approach similar to the ITPP-5 method (Minnis et al 1995), clear conditions are 
determined based on brightness thresholds, difference thresholds, and comparison of 
observations with first guess profiles. 

2.2.2 Objective 
The objective of this algorithm is to discriminate the cloudy pixels from the clear pixel in the 
image data.

2.4 
Algorithm Functional Specifications 
2.4.1 Overview 
Here we have combined the GOES cloud detection technique and some of the MODIS cloud 
discrimination methods. The new concept included here is to determine the threshold on the 
basis of clear sky temperature determined by compositing the multi-date image data. 

2.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
The theoretical basis of the algorithms and practical considerations are contained in this 
section. For nomenclature, we shall refer to the infrared radiance as brightness temperature 
(equivalent blackbody temperature determined using the Planck function) denoted as BT. 
Subscripts refer to the wavelength at which the measurement is made. 

Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the 
underlying earth surface. Simple visible and infrared window threshold approaches offer 
considerable skill in cloud detection; however, many surface conditions reduce cloud surface 
contrast in certain spectral regions, (e.g. bright clouds over snow and ice). 

2.4.1.2 Infrared Brightness Temperature Thresholds and Difference (BTD) Tests 
The azimuthally averaged form of the infrared radiative transfer equation is given by 
 (1) 
In addition to atmospheric structure, which determines B(T), the parameters describing the 
transfer of radiation through the atmosphere are the single scattering albedo, 0 = sca/ext, 
which ranges between 1 for a non-absorbing medium and 0 for a medium that absorbs and 
does not scatter energy, the optical depth, , and the Phase function, P(, ), which describes 
the direction of the scattered energy. 
To gain insight on the issue of detecting clouds using IR observations from satellites, it is 
useful to first consider the two-stream solution . Using the discrete-ordinates approach (Liou 
1973; Stamnes and Swanson 1981), the solution for the upward radiance from the top of a 
uniform single cloud layer is: 

 Iobs = MLexp(k) + M+L+ + B(Tc), (2) 

where 
I is the downward radiance (assumed isotropic) incident on the top of the cloud layer, I the 
upward radiance at the base of the layer, and g the asymmetry parameter. Tc is a 
representative temperature of the cloud layer. 

Cloud Mask 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

19
A challenge in cloud masking is detecting thin clouds. Assuming a thin cloud layer, the 
effective transmittance (ratio of the radiance exiting the layer to that incident on the base) is 
derived from equation (2) by expanding the exponential. The effective transmittance is a 
function of the ratio of I/I and B(Tc)/I. Using atmospheric window regions for cloud 
detection minimizes the I/I term and maximizes the B(Tc)/I term. Figure 3 is a simulation 
of differences in brightness temperature between clear and cloudy sky conditions using the 
simplified set of equations . In these simulations, there is no atmosphere, the surface is 
emitting at a blackbody temperature of 290 K, the cloud particles are ice spheres with a 
gamma size distribution assuming an effective radius of 10 m, and the cloud optical depth 
= 0.1. Two cloud temperatures are simulated (210 K and 250 K). Brightness temperature 
differences between the clear and cloudy sky are caused by non-linearity of the Planck 
function and spectral variation in the single scattering properties of the cloud. This figure 
does not include the absorption and emission of atmospheric gases, which would also 
contribute to brightness temperature differences. Observations of brightness temperature 
differences at two or more wavelengths can help separate the atmospheric signal from the 
cloud effect. 

Figure 3: A simple simulation of the brightness temperature differences between a clear 
and cloudy sky as a function of wavelength. The underlying temperature is 290 K and the 
cloud optical depth is 0.1. All computations assume ice spheres with re = 10 m. 

2.4.1.3 Methodology 
The basis of our methodology is, first to generate a clear composite of the maximum 
brightness temperature in thermal channels to get rough idea about the surface temperature in 
the clear sky condition at a particular time. Here assumption is that any pixel in the image 
will not be covered by cloud continuously at a particular time for several (user defined no.) 
days and the maximum brightness temperature will represent the clear sky background 
temperature of that location. This will be the reference background temperature on which the 
threshold for a particular location will be determined to discriminate cloud. 
First step : Generation of BTmax 
 BTmax = max (BT11 of each time of previous several (user defined no.) days) 
Default number of days for clear composite image is 20.

SIMPLE BT THRESHOLD TEST 
Several infrared window threshold and temperature difference techniques have been 
developed. These algorithms are most effective for cold clouds over water and must be used 
with caution in other situations. The first infrared test to apply is a simple threshold test. 
When the brightness temperature in the 11 m (BT11) channel is less by some threshold 
value than the maximum BT at that location, we assume the pixel to fail the clear-sky 
condition, because the change in BT will not be more than these due to change in other 
atmospheric condition.This was determined by some radiative transfer simulation for 
different atmospheric condition. This test gives a first set of cloudy pixels in the image. 

Second step : First set of cloudy pixels 
Over land : 
If (BTmax BT11 ) > 12 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels) 
Over ocean : 
If (BTmax BT11 ) > 6 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels) 

Third step : First set of clear pixels. 
If abs(BTmax BT11 ) < 2 K, then Cloudflag = 0 (Clear sky pixel) 

For rest of the points Cloudflag = 9 ( For further test ) 
For points with Cloudflag = 9 , 

SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATION 
Solar zenith angle has to be calculated for determining the day / night condition of the pixel. 
Solar zenith angle (s) : 
s (in radian) = /2 ASIN((SIN SIN(latitude)) + COS COS(latitude) COSH) (1) 
 (in radian) = solar declination angle = 0.39785SIN(4.869 + 0.0172cday + 
 0.03345SIN(6.224+0.0172cday)) 

 (2) 
H = sun hour angle at time ,t (in IST hrs.), in a calender day (cday) 

 IF (t GT 12) AND (longitude GT 82.5) THEN 
 H = t1 + L 

 (3) 
Otherwise, 
 IF ((t LT 12) AND (longitude LT 82.5)) THEN 
 H = t1 + L 

 (4) 
 Otherwise, 
 H = t1 L 

 (5) 
Where, 
 L = ABS(longitude 82.5) 

 (6) 
 t1 = 15(ABS(12-t))

If the solar zenith angle > 86.5 

Then pixel is considered to be falling in the night time.

BT11 - BT3.9 TEST (For points with Cloudflag = 9 ) 
Channel (3.9 m) measures radiances in the window region near 3.8-4 m so that the 
difference between BT11 and BT3.9 can be used to detect the presence of clouds. At night the 
difference between the brightness temperatures measured in the shortwave (3.9 m) and in 
the longwave (11 m) window regions (BT11 BT3.9) can be used to detect partial cloud or 
thin cloud within the INSAT field of view. Small or negative differences are observed only 
for the case where an opaque scene (such as thick cloud or the surface) fills the field of view 
of the sensor. Negative differences occur at night over extended clouds due to the lower 
cloud emissivity at 3.9 m. 
During the daylight hours the difference between BT11 and BT3.9 is large and negative 
because of reflection of solar energy at 3.9 m. This technique is very successful at detecting 
low-level water clouds. 
Moderate to large differences between BT11 and BT3.9 result when a nonuniform scene (e.g., 
broken cloud) is observed. The different spectral response to a scene of non-uniform 
temperature is a result of Plancks law. The brightness temperature dependence on the 
warmer portion of the scene increasing with decreasing wavelength (the shortwave window 
Planck radiance is proportional to temperature to the thirteenth power, while the longwave 
dependence is to the fourth power). Differences in the brightness temperatures of the 
longwave and shortwave channels are small when viewing mostly clear or mostly cloudy 
scenes; however, for intermediate situations the differences become large (greater than 3C). 
Table 2 lists examples of the thresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. We have used similar 
thresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. 
The application of BT11 BT3.9 is difficult in deserts during daytime. Bright desert 
regions with highly variable emissivities tend to be incorrectly classified as cloudy with this 
test. The problem is mitigated somewhat in the cloud mask by making use of a double-sided 
test where brightness temperature differences greater than a "low" threshold but less than a 
"high" threshold are labeled clear while values outside this range are called cloudy. The 
thresholds are listed in Table 2. This threshold strategy along with the use of clear-sky 
restoral tests is effective for detecting low-level clouds over deserts. We are leaving these 
regions as undetermined if it is failing other tests. 
Detecting clouds at high latitudes using infrared window is a challenging problem due to the 
cold surface temperatures. Yamanouchi et al. (1987) describe a nighttime polar (Antarctic) 
cloud/surface discrimination algorithm based upon brightness temperature differences 
between the AVHRR 3.7 and 11 m channels and between the 11 and 12 m channels. We 
are not attempting at those regions because data at such large angle of view is not very useful 
and not used for any parameter retrieval. 
 Table 2: Thresholds used for BT11 BT3.9 test for low clouds are same as in the MODIS 
cloud mask algorithm.

BT3.7 - BT12 TEST 
This window brightness temperature difference test is applied during the nighttime over some, 
but not all, surfaces. This difference is useful for separating thin cirrus and cloud free 
condition and is relatively insensitive to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere 
(Hutchison and Hardy 1995). This test is executed over land at night. The three thresholds for 
MODIS algorithm are 15, 10, and 5 K, for low confidence, mid-point, and high confidence, 
respectively. Over snow-covered surfaces, the thresholds are 4.50, 4.00, and 3.50K. We shall 
be using only the high confidence thresholds. 

NIGHT OCEAN SPATIAL VARIABILITY TEST 
The standard deviation of 3x3 arrays of 11 m brightness temperatures centered on the pixels 
of interest is calculated for ocean scenes at night. The clear-sky ocean surface is usually very 
uniform over regions of this size and, in general, the presence of clouds increases the 
variability. The thresholds for MODIS algorithm are 0.2K, 0.1K, and 0.05K for low, mid-
point, and high confidences, respectively. The reader will note that these values are very 
restrictive, yet some very uniform low clouds are not detected by this test. For INSAT, we 
are using threshold of 0.05 K. 
If the Standard deviation in 3 x 3 array of BT11 is less 0.05 then the pixel is a clear sky 
pixel. 
 If < 0.05 then cloudflag = 0 for the center pixel. 

SPATIAL UNIFORMITY TEST 
The previous test is applied only over the ocean. Spatial Uniformity test is applied to all 
pixels. The standard deviation , Tmean and Tmaxmean of the 3 x 3 array for the 11 m 
brightness temperatures centerd on the pixel of interest is computed. 
If the | Tmaxmean - Tmean | 2.0 and < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 0. 
Over Land , 
If (Tmean - Tmaxmean ) 12.0 K and < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 1. 
Over Ocean, 
If (Tmean - Tmaxmean ) 6.0 K and < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 1. 

ADJACENT PIXEL TEST 
After all the above tests , for the remaining pixel, where cloudflag = 9, in the 3 x 3 array of 
the 11 m brightness temperatures, find the number of cloudy (n1) and clear (n2) pixels. 
If n1 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 1 
If n2 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 0 

TEMPORAL UNIFORMITY TEST 
The remaining pixels with cloudflag 9 are compared with the pixels of previous hour image. 
If the difference in BT11 is less than 1K then it is assumed that the atmospheric condition 
over that pixel has not changed much from the previous hour and the cloudflag of that pixel 
from previous hour is carried over to the current data 
If | BT11 (current image) BT11 (previous hour image) | 1 K then 
 Cloudflag (current) = cloudflag (previous) 
. 
FINAL THRESHOLD TEST 
Cloud Mask 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

23
For remaining uncertain points (cloudflag = 9) final threshold test is done to assign probably 
clear or cloudy flag to each pixel. In this test 
Over land : 
If 2 < | BT11 BTmax | 6 then cloudflag = 2 (probably clear) 
And if 6 < | BT11 BTmax | 12 then cloudflag = 3 (probably cloudy) 
Over ocean : 
If 2 < | BT11 BTmax | 3 then cloudflag = 2 (probably clear) 
And if 3 < | BT11 BTmax | 6 then cloudflag = 3 (probably cloudy) 
 For further testing one can use the reflectance test in visible and some other test to determine 
whether it is clear or cloudy.

3.2 
Introduction 
The total amount of the thermal radiation (4 100 m wavelength bands) that is emitted 
from the earth-atmosphere system to the outer space is called outgoing longwave radiation 
(OLR). Besides the broadband instruments that are dedicated for observing the OLR, for 
example, Cloud and Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES), there are many algorithms 
that estimate OLR by converting the narrowband radiances into broadband flux (OLR; 
Ellingson et al. 1989, Ellingson et al. 1994, Singh et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010). Algorithm 
to estimate the OLR from the Geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) imager 
observed WV (6.5 7.1 m) and thermal infrared (TIR-1; 10.3 11.3 m and TIR-2; 11.5 
12.5 m) radiances has been developed in the frame of the IMDPS. The developed algorithm 
will be used operationally when data from the INSAT-3D satellite will be available. 
Algorithm to estimate the OLR is developed using two basic approaches: 

i. 
In the first approach, a large database of spectral radiance fields and broadband flux 
(OLR) built using Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used to develop 
the algorithm. The radiative transfer computations are performed at 19400 
wavelengths covering the thermal region (4100 m) and for 4704 realistic 
conditions of the Earthatmosphere system. 

ii. 
In the second approach, INSAT-3D imager radiances collocated (in space and time) 
with CERES OLR available from Terra and Aqua satellites, are used to develop the 
algorithm.

3.2.1 Overview and background 
The earth and its atmosphere absorb the shortwave (SW) radiation coming from the sun and 
emit thermal longwave (LW) radiation to space. These two radiation streams can be 
represented approximately by blackbody radiation of 6000K for the solar SW and 290K for 
the terrestrial (LW). The balance between the incoming SW radiation and the LW determines 
the temperature in the atmosphere and on the earths surface. Outgoing longwave radiation 
(OLR) is the emission to space of terrestrial radiation (LW) from the top of the earth's 
atmosphere. OLR is strongly controlled by three main meteorological variables, namely the 
temperature of the earth and the atmosphere above it, the presence of water vapor in the 
atmosphere (which strongly absorbs infra-red radiation attenuating the terrestrial signal) and 
the presence of clouds (which may completely block all outgoing infra-red radiation from the 
surface). Thus, OLR reveal information on the temperature, humidity and cloudiness of the 
atmosphere. Allan et al. (1999) state that changes in humidity in the mid-troposphere (400 to 
700 hPa) are most important in explaining clear-sky OLR variations. 
The estimates of outgoing longwave radiation, both operational and experimental 
have been particularly useful for variety of problems in climate sensitivity and diagnostics 
(e.g., Schmetz and Liu, 1988), numerical weather forecasting and climate models. The OLR 
has been used traditionally for radiation budget studies of the earth-atmosphere system. The 
top of the atmosphere radiative energy balance between net incoming solar radiation and 
OLR is crucial in determining the large-scale atmospheric circulation and, therefore, the 
synoptic evolution that is important for weather and climate prediction. OLR is a major 
component of the Earths Radiation Budget, which drives the atmospheric circulation, 
particularly over the tropics. This is mainly due to the fact that in the tropics, the OLR is 
largely modulated by cloudiness. In particular, it varies with cloud top temperature and 
consequently, low radiation values indicate the major convective system. Generally, values 
less than 250 Wm-2 would give a good indication of the cloudiness over the tropics. 
The observations of OLR by earth orbiting satellites have been made from the 
beginning of the environmental satellite program. Besides the broadband instruments that are 
dedicated for observing the OLR, for example, Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), 
Scanner Radiometer for Radiation Budget (ScaRab), and Cloud and Earths Radiant Energy 
System (CERES), there are many algorithms that estimate OLR by converting the 
narrowband radiance observations into broadband flux (4100 m). The OLR was routinely 
obtained from the 1012 m window on operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellite beginning in 1974 (Gruber and Winston, 
1978). Early operational estimation of OLR employed a simple parameterization using the 
window channel brightness temperature of the advanced very high resolution radiometer 
(AVHRR) on NOAA 67 (Ellingson and Ferraro, 1983; Gruber and Krueger, 1984). New 
algorithms were developed in subsequent years to improve the accuracy of the OLR. 
Ellingson et al. (1989) have shown that the linear combination of only four (6.6 6.9 m; 
7.98.5 m; 13.113.6 m; 14.314.7 m) High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) 
channels could account for more than 99% of the OLR total variance. Comparison with the 
ERBE (Ellingson et al., 1994) instrument flown in NOAA 911 satellites suggested that 
estimates made with HIRS data exhibited errors of the same order as the estimated accuracy 
of ERBE (5 Wm-2), where as use of AVHRR data exhibits monthly bias of -1 to +2 Wm-2 
and rms differences of about 14 Wm-2 (Gruber et al., 1994).

Geostationary satellite observations have also been used for OLR estimation. Schmetz and 
Liu (1988) and Cheruy et al. (1991) developed OLR retrieval technique using two channels 
(infrared window and water vapor) of Meteosat. Minnis et al. (1991) developed an algorithm 
to estimate OLR using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager 
window channels with additional water vapor information from analysis. Ba and Ellingson 
(2001) estimated OLR using several channels of the GOES sounder and presented 
comparisons with the CERES measurements. Ba et al. (2003) adapted the HIRS technique to 
GOES sounder and validated the derived OLR with collocated OLR measured from CERES 
onboard Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Terra satellites. Their results 
show instantaneous agreement within about 7 Wm-2. Singh et al. (2007) estimated OLR using 
the infrared window and water vapor channels radiances from Kalpana. 

Objective

7.1 m), TIR-1 (10.3 11.3 m) and TIR-2 (11.5 12.5 m) channels of INSAT-3D imager. 
Algorithm is developed using two basic approaches: 
i. 
First approach (ALG-1) uses RTM simulated INSAT-3D radiances and OLR

3.3.2 Other Auxiliary data and Model Input 
To develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR using 
radiative transfer approach (ALG-1), a large database of the atmospheric profiles of 
temperature (T), pressure, water vapor (q), and ozone (O3) concentrations are required. These 
profiles are extracted from the TIGR-3 database (Chevallier, Chedin, Cheruy, & Morcrette, 
2000), which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected among a larger set of worldwide 
soundings. Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone from 
ECMWF are taken.

3.4.1 Overview 
Generally, broadband Radiometer provides the accurate measurements of emitted longwave 
radiation at top of the atmosphere (TOA). Since narrow field-of-view (NFOV) radiometers 
on-board satellites, such as CERES, measure the upwelling radiance only in specific 
outgoing directions from a scene on Earth at any given time, OLR cannot be measured 
instantaneously. Given a radiance field, L(, ) , at the TOA, where is the satellite viewing 
zenith angle, and the azimuth angle, the OLR leaving the earth-atmosphere system, is 
obtained by integrating the radiance field over the solid angle of the upper hemisphere:

For an isotropic radiance field, the radiance to OLR conversion is simple (OLR=L). 
Unfortunately, the radiance field L(, ) is not isotropic and an accurate portraying of the 
anisotropy is needed to estimate the OLR from the radiance measurement. The anisotropic 
emission factor (AEF) R(, ) is defined as the ratio of the equivalent Lambertian OLR to 
the actual OLR (Loeb et al., 2003).

Eq. (3) is widely used to infer the OLR from the radiance measurement L(, ) available 
from the broadband (4 m 100 m ) radiometers (e.g CERES, ScaRab, ERBE, etc) 
As mentioned above, the OLR is obtained by integrating the radiances over the long-wave 
spectral range and over hemispheric solid angles. However, if the observations at entire (e.g 
4 m 100 m) spectral range are not available, a mapping function of the following form 
should be determined to retrieve OLR from the available, narrow band radiances:

Radiative Transfer Model 

Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model developed by 
Ricchiazzi et al (1998) at University of California is used for INSAT-3D imager radiance 
simulations. SBDART is designed for the analysis of a wide variety of radiative transfer 
problems encountered in satellite remote sensing and atmospheric energy budget studies. 
SBDART is based on a collection of highly developed and reliable physical models 
developed by the atmospheric science community. A brief description to the key components 
of the model is discussed below: 
Cloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earths climate by reflecting visible 
radiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-radiating 
it back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy atmosphere 
requires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, and the 
asymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART contains an 
internal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie scattering code and 
covers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to 128 m. By default, the 
angular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple Henyey-Greenstein 
parameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input as desired. 
Gas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed for 
the LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis, 1986). 
These models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmission from 0 to 50000 cm-1 and 
include the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's atmosphere. 
The models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were degraded to 20 
cm-1 resolution for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength resolution of about 
0.005 m in the visible and about 0.2 m in the thermal infrared. A capability to read high-
resolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is introduced in SBDART version 2.0 
which is less convenient to use than the standard approach. However, it has the advantage of 
removing limitations in the ultimate spectral resolution available with SBDART. 
Extraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar 
spectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models used 
in 5s or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum. 
Standard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from the 
5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions: tropical, 
mid-latitude summer, mid-latitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and US62. 
These model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the 
atmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure, 
temperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own model 
Outgoing longwave radiation 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

35
atmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as CO2 or CH4 
are assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the user) of the total 
particle density. 
Standard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several common 
boundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the user can select 
from rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of boundary layer 
aerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorological visibility at 0.55 m and an 
internal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5 aerosol layers can be 
specified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged volcanic, meteoric and the 
climatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol models included in SBDART 
were derived from those provided in the 5s and LOWTRAN7. 
Radiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically 
integrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988). The 
discrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the equations of 
plane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. The intensity of 
both scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at different heights and 
directions. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric layers and 40 radiation 
streams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes). 
Surface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall 
radiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water, 
vegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface. 
The spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by 
combinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and sand 
can be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth, or 
deciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity of 
water with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil. 
3.4.1.2 
RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances 
 To develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR a large 
database of spectral radiance fields was built using SBDART model. The radiative transfer 
computations were performed at 19400 wavelengths covering the thermal region 4100 m 
for 4704 realistic conditions of the Earthatmosphere system. For each element in the 
database, the main inputs for the radiative transfer computations were: the atmospheric 
profiles of temperature, pressure, water vapor, and ozone concentrations. These profiles are 
extracted from the TIGR-3 database, which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected 
among a larger set of worldwide soundings. Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature, 
water vapor and ozone from ECMWF were also taken. The surface temperature is set close to 
the temperature at the level close to surface in the profile. The cloud cover is generated 
randomly. The cloud cover may contain up to three overlapping layers, each characterized by 
a random height, optical thickness, phase (water or ice), and drop size distribution. Half of 
the database (2352 elements) corresponds to cloud-free conditions and the other half 
corresponds to the same conditions but with the addition of cloud cover. For each element in 
the database, the OLR and the spectral radiance field L (={0, 5, . . . 65}) are computed. 
Filter response function for the INSAT-3D imager WV and thermal channel (TIR-1 and TIR-
2) were provided as input to the SBDART. Radiances were simulated for each set of profile

36
and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (70 km) from SBDART for WV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 
channels. 
 3.4.1.3 Conversion of Narrow Band Radiances to Broad Band Flux (OLR) 
ALG-1 is developed using RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances. While ALG-2 is 
developed using the INSAT-3D radiances and collocated (in space and time) CERES 
measured OLR. In practice, development of ALG-2 is possible only after the launch of 
INSAT-3D. However, to develop the preliminary version, we have used Visible Infrared 
Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2D (positioned at 86.5 E) radiances to generate 
proxy radiances for INSAT-3D. This is due to the fact that INSAT-3D channels (TIR-1, TIR-
2 and WV), which will be used for the development of OLR algorithm, are very similar to 
those of FY-2D channels. INSAT-3D radiances are generated using VISSR measured 
radiances by accounting the difference in the radiances due to the SRF differences of FY-2D 
and INSAT-3D channels. We have also developed the algorithm to estimate the OLR using 
FY-2D measured radiances. 
The FY-2D radiance data from 1-15 July and 1-15 December, 2011 over the FY-2D 
full disk domain were collocated with CERES SSF data from all four instruments (FM1, 
FM2, FM3 and FM4) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The FY-2D radiance 
observations were averaged for 4x4 pixels (native resolution is 5 km at the sub-satellite 
point) to match the CERES resolution (about 20 km nadir). The criterion for the FY-2D and 
CERES collocations is taken as time coincidence within 5 minutes and a distance window 
of 5 km radius between the FY-2D and the CERES observations. These collocated 
narrowband radiances, satellite zenith angle and OLR are then used to find the empirical 
relationship between the OLR, satellite zenith angle and narrowband radiances (Channels; 
IR1, IR2 and IR3 of FY-2D). Using a radiative transfer simulation, we found empirical 
relationship between INSAT-3D and FY-2D radiances. The developed empirical relationship 
was then applied on FY-2D measured radiances to obtain the INSAT-3D radiances. These 
FY-2D measured radiances and the INSAT-3D simulated radiances using FY-2D measured 
radiances and collocated CERES OLR were used to develop the OLR algorithm (under 
second approach: ALG-2). 
In both approaches (ALG-1 and ALG-2), genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine 
the optimum relationship between broadband flux (OLR) and spectral radiances of WV and 
thermal infrared channels. A unique advantage of GA is that complex (often nonlinear) 
relationships between different variables can be obtained in the form of simple and usable 
equations. In the case of other nonlinear methods like ANN, the task of using the algorithm 
often requires a complete understanding of the neural network, which includes a complex 
array of input layers, hidden layers, the shape of the response function at each layer, and the 
weights connecting these layers. A major difference between other nonlinear techniques (like 
ANN) and GA is that the algorithm development under GA is almost completely objective 
and data adaptive. 
The development of the OLR retrieval algorithm involves a number of steps. In the 
first step, the collocated data of narrowband radiances (both FY-2D and INSAT-3D), satellite 
zenith angle and OLR were divided into two unequal random samples. Sample I is used to 
train the GA and Sample II is used for evaluation of the algorithm. Genetic algorithm (GA) 
was then applied to find optimal relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR for 
Outgoing longwave radiation 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

37
training data (Sample I). The GA training provides empirical equations (INSAT-3D as well 
as FY-2D) relating OLR to narrowband radiances and satellite zenith angle. The root mean 
square error (rmse) on the training data is about 7 Wm-2. The developed algorithm was 
applied on the Sample-II data in order to compute the OLR. The computed OLR for Sample-
II data was compared with observed OLR and the root mean square error (rmse) was 
computed. The root mean square error (rmse) is about 9 Wm-2 (about 3 %) for both FY-2D 
and INSAT-3D. 
3.4.1.4 Genetic algorithm 
Modeling natural phenomena has been a standard practice in atmospheric sciences. 
Traditionally, modeling a physical system requires one to derive the relevant equations from 
first principles taking into account the physical laws that determine the system under 
consideration. Alternatively, when such an approach is not feasible due to some reasons, e.g., 
the perfect physics of the system is not well understood, or the required computing resources 
are not available, empirical laws governing the physical processes can be obtained by model-
fitting approaches based on the observed variability of the system and its relationship with 
other parameters. Let us assume that there exists a smooth mapping function P(.) that 
explains the relationship between a predicted variable x and a set of dependent variables 
[a,b,c,d,e,], so that 

 x = P [a,b,c,d,e, ..] (6) 
 In various areas of geophysics, it is a standard practice to employ linear or 
nonlinear regression techniques in order to obtain the form of P(.). However, the choice of a 
regression model is quite subjective, and it is difficult to ensure that a particular regression 
model provides the best possible explanation to the variance in a data set. This has inspired 
the researchers to look for more objective data fitting approaches like genetic algorithm 
(GA). A genetic algorithm is programmed to approximate the equation, in symbolic form, 
that best describes the relationship between independent and dependent parameters. The 
genetic algorithm considers an initial population of potential solutions, which is subjected to 
an evolutionary process, by selecting those equations (individuals) that best fit the data. The 
strongest strings (made up from a combination of variables, real numbers, and arithmetic 
operators) of choose a mate for reproduction whereas the weaker strings become extinct. The 
newly generated population is subjected to mutations that change fractions of information. 
The evolutionary steps are repeated with the new generation. The process ends after a 
number of generations a priori determined by the user. The procedural details of genetic 
algorithm can be found in Szpiro (1997), Alvarez et al., (2000) and Singh et al (2006). A 
brief description of genetic algorithm is as follows. 
First, for a desired function x (e.g. in Eq.-6), a set of candidate equations for P(.) is 
randomly generated. An equation is stored in the computer as a set of characters that define 
the independent variables, a, b,c,d,e.. etc. in Eq. (6), and four elementary arithmetic operators 
(+,-,x, and /). A criterion that measures how well the equation strings perform on a training 
set of the data is its fitness to the data, defined as sum of the squared differences between 
data and independent parameter derived from the equation string. The strongest individuals 
(equations with best fits) are then selected to exchange parts of the character strings between 
them (reproduction and crossover) while individuals less fitted to the data are discarded. 
Finally, a small percentage of the equation strings most basic elements, single operators and 
Outgoing longwave radiation 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

38
variables, are mutated at random. The process is repeated a large number of times to improve 
the fitness of the evolving population of equations. The fitness strength of the best scoring 
equation is defined as: 
R2 = 1 [2 / (xo- <xo> )2] 
 (7) 
 where 2 = (xc xo)2, xc is parameter value estimated by the best scoring equation, xo is 
the corresponding true value, <xo> is the mean of the true values of x. Szpiro (1997) has 
shown the robustness of the genetic algorithm to forecast the behavior of one-dimensional 
chaotic dynamical system.

INTRODUCTION 
Weather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many 
aspects of the world's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important 
components of Weather and climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange 
of water substance between sea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and 
evaporation processes significantly affect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative 
assessment of precipitation is needed to improve understanding of the behavior of global 
energy and circulation patterns as well as the nature of climate variability. The choice of 
measured parameter has been influenced by the cost of installation, operation, longevity and 
temporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The land based techniques of rainfall 
estimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as about 70% of the Earth is 
covered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of rainfall is, therefore, a 
topic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and ocean for an 
extended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the improved 
identification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature and 
development of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and 
time span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The 
primary scope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence, 
amount and distribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of 
rain gauges and weather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans 
have significantly limited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most 
variable quantities in space and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that 
other atmospheric phenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events 
and flash floods (Barrett and Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS) 
and infrared (IR) imagers provide the rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the 
growth and decay of precipitating clouds. Microwaves provide the interaction of radiation 
with hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and limited swath widths of satellites with in

tropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al., 
1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) series. 
4.2.1 Overview 
Operational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of 
precipitating systems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts 
for non-unique solutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett 
and Martin (1981) and Kidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the 
available methods. Petty (1995) has examined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over 
land. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001) has covered results and future perspectives from 
the geostationary orbit. The perspective varies widely from the relatively simple methods 
used for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and Ardanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991) 
to the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate estimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and 
Gruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al., 1998). 
 Recent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have 
been dramatic but the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary 
satellites is still indispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of 
geostationary satellites, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M 
series (Menzel and Purdom,1994) and the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation 
(MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager 
(SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV triplet. Some of the new channels 
have been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer 
(AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
polar orbiters or have other heritages. 
Multispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and 
geostationary satellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels 
for cloud characterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at 
geosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring 
of precipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years 
since more and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will 
allow for global real-time cloud characterization. 
Cloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since 
been studied and documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993, 
Saunders and Kriebel, 1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative 
properties are sensitive to the size distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase 
in the particle size increases the transmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the 
emissivity of the cloud layer. This latter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the 
3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity of a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR 
window: there is a large contribution of reflected radiation at the cloud top. Clouds with 
small hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm radiance. An increase in cloud 
particle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the cloud top reduces the 3.9 
mm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar radiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 
mm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals are generally larger 
than cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud particles effective 
radius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth.

Several methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from 
various cloud types. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and 
Nakajima and King (1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form 
between 22,000 and 35,000 feet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates 
areas of moisture. Black depicts neutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a 
multispectral rainfall estimation technique based on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman 
(1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 km2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) 
showed to be the critical limit beyond which a further increase in cloud cluster area does not 
result in higher rain rates. 
IR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for 
application to rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective 
rainfall areas using split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 
1987a,b, 1997) and are instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 
1985). These techniques rely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level 
cumulus clouds using the two window channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 m (the so-
called split window). The information content of the split window channels partially corrects 
erroneous rainfall area delineation (and consequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple 
IR techniques producing better false alarm ratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 m channel of GOES-
8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable for applications to rainfall detection and 
estimation. This channel was included for a long time in NOAA/AVHRR instruments 
(centered at 3.7 m) for a variety of purposes including ice discrimination and sun-glint 
detection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for rainfall retrieval using 
the 11 and 3.9 m channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use and sensitivity to 
the presence of ice and water vapor. 
In the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be 
developed and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of 
NOAA from the data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard 
INSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), 
Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the 
spectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6m, NIR 1.6m, MWIR 3.9m, WV 
6.7m, IR 10.8m, IR 12.0m . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as 
mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. 

4.2.2 Objectives 
There are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These 
techniques are popularly known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and GOES Multispectral 
Rainfall Algorithm Technique (GMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at 
estimation of rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal 
requirements respectively. First GPI related objectives are the implementation of the 
algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the second one is related to the development of the 
algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber (2001). Originally the GPI technique has 
been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by Global community for more than 
two decades. The GMSRA on the other hand is a new one and is developed and used only by 
USA based on integrated efforts from many group of researchers along with the supporting

infrastructure (like ground truths with high spatial and temporal coverages etc.). from a 
hundred of radars on the ground. 
The inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as 
the rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical 
connection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance 
emanating from cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only 
marginally even with significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal 
coverage of Geostationary optical measurements is the very strong point along with the 
resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical 
connections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice 
hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms 
till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only low earth orbiting 
satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as on now. With 
the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single satellite (e.g. 
Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisage that a technique like GMSRA 
can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information can 
be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm 
(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the 
techniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below 
(mainly in cases of IMSRA). 
A1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method: 
1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 
um) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 
1300E using Arkins GPI method. 
2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 
deg latitude/longitude. 
 3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 
images a day). 
 4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data. 
 5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc. 
 6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales 
after due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. 
A2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm 
(IMSRA) Technique: 
The relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive 
radiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, 
has not yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. 
There are numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information 
at scales smaller than the existing 1.0 products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at 
resolutions of 1 and down to the 0.25 0) would be invaluable. There is also increasing 
demand from the meteorology and climate community for such products over extended 
periods. High-resolution rainfall information is available for limited areas using

combinations of ground-based radar and dense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, 
where the need of high spatial and temporal rainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of 
India (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan Regions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-
Arid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure necessary for this form of precipitation 
monitoring network is not in place. Recent developments mostly refer to microwave (MW) 
sensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors of 
geostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over. Thus a suit of both 
supplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the highly 
advanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near 
real time basis. 
The main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing 
a Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of 
the innovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements 
from polar orbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that 
combines satellite passive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both 
data types. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal 
frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few 
years, a number of groups world wide have embarked on development of such techniques 
wherein the advantages of geosynchronous viz. vast coverage and near sufficient space-
time sampling, and polar passive microwave radiometers viz. more physically based 
retrievals, are synergistically used to generate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g. 
Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background 
the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. 
The technique has the following components: 
1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m-
6.7m), which corresponds well with rainfall. 
2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and 
non-rain baring clouds. 
3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR TBs. 
4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent 
clouds based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness 
temperatures colder than 240K. 
5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / 
SSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. 
6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top 
brightness temperature ( 11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds 
along with Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave 
Imager-TMI).

7. To adjust the rainfall estimates in association with the product of Integrated 
Precipitable water and Relative Humidity from 500 mb Surface (from Eta/IMD 
model). 
8. Validation of rainfall with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of 
algorithm. 
9. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid 
scales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm.

In addition to satellite data from INSAT-3D, radar and rain gauge data, and atmospheric 
moisture products (integrated precipitable water and relative humidity from 500-mb surface) 
obtained from the IMD/Eta Model analysis are essential on required grid spacing in different 
temporal scales. The gridded rainfall data from Doppler Weather Radars are needed from

IMD at every one hourly time interval on 1x1 and 0.25x0.25 deg grid resolution for GPI and 
IMSRA techniques. The rainfall from DWRs should be well calibrated and the products 
should be well converted to rain rate using an appropriate Z-R relation well tested and 
validated over Indian regional sites of the respective radar locations. In some cases one 
hourly rainfall from fast response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas 
where the DWR coverage is not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain 
rates, and hourly and daily gauge rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important. The 
Eta / IMD model forcast/analysed fields of total precipitable water (TPW) and relative 
humidity fields should be available from IMD at every 3 hourly within 0.5x0.5 respectively.

4.4.1 Overview: 
NOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. 
Heavy precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the 
global scale to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite-
derived algorithms, conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide 
information on these various scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and 
flash floods. In the satellite data, global scale connections between the tropics and middle 
latitudes are observed. These connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor 
that are often associated with unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy 
precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic scale, the 6.7 m water vapor is especially

useful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and other features that are associated with 
upward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air resulting in the production of clouds 
and precipitation. Whether or not heavy precipitation and flash floods will occur are 
generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the mesoscale, infrared (10.7 m 
and 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal 
and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy 
precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring, 
intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, movement, 
and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine how 
much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three 
hours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal 
data sets used in this diagnosis. 
Large scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale 
precipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. 
Satellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) 
estimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) 
estimation of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day 
to a month e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is 
based on some statistical relationship. 
In case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when 
available to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of 
hydrometeors during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 
mm) and 5 (12 mm). The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness 
temperature, and the 12-mm channel is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to 
estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute 
the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then subtracted from measurements of that channel 
to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm spectral band. 
In the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite 
sensor and surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of 
brightness temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies 
with BT. The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this 
relationship Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly 
rainfall over large areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal 
errors cancel each other in the aggregation procedure. 
Complete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A, INSAT-3D 
VHRR data from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been asked for. Both of 
them are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research 
and development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and 
GMSRA respectively are given below: 
4.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm: 
4.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images 
The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the 
atmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated 
over all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

52
temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium 
emits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, 
than a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its 
emission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is 
related to its physical temperature T by following equation: 
Tb = T 
where, is emissivity of the object. If. = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if = 0, Tb = 0, its a 
white body; if 0 < < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. 
The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a 
atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In 
this band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous 
constituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, 
measured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those 
surfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated 
by effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will 
be referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be 
measured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be 
unity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called 
`brightness temperature. Only when = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body 
temperature. 
The value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of 
lapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with 
height, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be 
infrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this 
context, because < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). 
The more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick 
but are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds which extend into 
lower troposphere.

4.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI: 

4.4.1.1.3 Operational Implementation 
Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT 
The INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, ., 2100 UTC, i.e., 
every three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 8 x 8 km in case of 
KALPANA and INSAT-3A and 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, so that several pixels 
fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of each pixel in a given 
image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be calculated from a 
look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be ignored while 
within it are assigned to appropriate box. 
Step 2: Histogram Generation: 
After the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed 
to generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um)

images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and 
30 to 130 deg longitude from the sub-satellite point. 
Step 3: Grid-wise Statistics 
Generate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg 
latitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. 
Step 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: 
The fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler 
than specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the 
measure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than 
threshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid 
spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon will be carried out. This work indicated a high 
correlation between the fractional coverage of "cold" clouds and observed rainfall. It 
was determined that the highest correlation between the parameters was produced 
using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. An estimation method using linear 
regression was developed. The regression procedure yielded the simple estimation 
equation: 
R = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours] 
where R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of 
cloud-top temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; 
and hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period. 
Step: 5 Sub-Grid Scale Rainfall: 
In order to produce precipitation estimates at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, it 
is necessary to develop an improved method. Sub grid scale is possible with help of 
recent developments at NOAA/NESDIS. However, the GPI algorithm will also be 
attempted to provide at 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grids by some alternative 
approach. Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, moving average, monthly 
mean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. 
Step: 6 Validations: 
Regarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR (at present four at Chennai, 
SHAR, Kolkatta, Machliputtnam and some more are planned by IMD) and Surface 
Rain Gauges (SFRG) Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly 
desirable in and around the maximum validation sites in temporal window of every 
hour. 
Remarks: 
During the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided 
with a flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when 
more than 50% of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or 
Monthly scale average rainfall estimates.

The developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) 
proposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along 
with innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) 
for the estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that 
1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are 
expanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. 
2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. 
3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging 
clouds. 
4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a 
convective system. 
5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and 
thus effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during 
day time). 
6. The humidity and total precipitable water as a background field characterizes the 
rainfall process identification. 
7. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the 
associated instantaneous rain rate can be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain 
rate for cloud top brightness temperature using Satellite Passive Microwave 
Radiometer (e.g. TRMM-TMI) and/or Active Microwave Radar (TRMM-PR). 
8. Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on 
available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the 
algorithm. 
9. Production of rainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and above 
grid spacing. 

Several such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using 
measurements from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical 
explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is 
common for GPI algorithm. In addition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) 
images is being presented here in brief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with 
thicker clouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is 
strongest for clouds warmer than -15 C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier 
rainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet 
growth rates. In clouds warmer than -15 C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large 
cloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However, 
the other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also 
important. Difference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds

56
were attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and 
difference in evaporation below the cloud base. 
Satellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able 
to provide accurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have but poor 
temporal sampling. Again the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias 
in regions where diurnal cycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous 
measurements of rainfall from microwave sensors are more accurate and thus are useful in 
calibrating other sensors like visible and IR. At present, the algorithms for the quantitative 
estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are quite successful but suffer from a 
scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. Theoretical and empirical studies 
addressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical assessment continues to appear. A 
definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because of the complex and variable 
microphysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis--vis coarser resolution of 
microwave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the rainfall data from 
the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several algorithms have been 
developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall used here is 
based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width of 
about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by 
NASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is 
most plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation 
of rain estimates from IR measurements. 
Following the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, that combines mul-
tispectral measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the present algorithm, 
IMSRA is thus proposed in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. 
Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms 
alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single 
and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses cloud-top 
temperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995; 
Vicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and 
Gutman 1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; 
Vicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the following steps 
which are heavily drawn from (Ba, M., and A. Gruber, 2001). 

Step 1. Screening Method: 
One of the most important aspects in estimating rainfall using IR measurements is to 
distinguish nonprecipitating cirrus from active cold convective clouds. To remove cirrus 
clouds, an empirical procedure developed by Adler and Negri (1988) was adapted in 
NOAA/NESDIS for areas smaller than originally applied. A slope (S) and a temperature 
gradient (G,) are computed for each local temperature minimum in a window of 25 GOES 
pixels [note that Adler and Negri (1988) searched an entire cloud area for points colder than 
their neighbors]. The terms G, and S are given by Eq. (I) and Eq. (2), respectively: 
Gt = Tavg -Tmin 
and 

(1) 
S = 0.568 (Tmin -217) 

(2) 
where T min is the local minimum in the window of 25 X 25 pixels, and as in Adler and 
Negri (1988), Tavg is the mean temperature of the 6 pixels surrounding the current pixel (4 
pixels along the scan and 2 pixels across the scan because the pixel offset along the scan is 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

57
approximately one-half as large as across the scan). Based on G and S the decision is made 
about the cirrus delineation. 
There are many channels needed for this screening procedure and has been originally 
developed only for mid latitudes, we are aware of a more recent cloud classification approach 
by CNES as an alternative (Roca et al. 2002). This method is based on classification of clear 
sky, low clouds, warm semitransparent clouds, mid-to-upper level clouds or without thin 
cirrus above, mid-to-upper level clouds, and finally deep convection with or without thin 
cirrus above. 

Step 2: Micro-physical properties of clouds: 

During the day time when the visible channel is available and the radiance at 3.9 mm is 
dominated by the solar reflected part, the effective radius of cloud particles at the cloud tops 
can be computed for overcast pixels. As stated by Ba and Gruber (2001), the first step in 
deriving the effective particle radius consists of selecting only pixels filled with optically 
thick clouds because measurements obtained from thin clouds include radiances both emitted 
and reflected by clouds. For optically thick clouds defined as having a visible reflectance 
greater than 0.40, the transmissivity at 3.9mm wavelength can be neglected. So with the 
assumption that the cloud is a Lambertian surface, the emissivity can be expressed by 1 - A, 
where A is the spectral albedo at 3.9 mm. Thus, the observed radiance L at 3.9 mm is then 
given by 

L = AS0/ + (1-A) PEBB 

(3) 
where So is the solar irradiance in the GOES 3.9-J.l0l band and PEBB is the equivalent 
blackbody emitted thermal radiation at 3.9 mm for cloud-top temperature T,. Thus, the albedo 
A is obtained from Eq. (4): 

A = L PEBB /(S0/ - PEBB) 
(4) 
The effective radius of cloud particles is defined as 

where N(r) is the number concentration of particles having radius r. The effective radius, 
which is dependent on the spectral albedo A at 3.9 m, is retrieved using the results obtained 
by Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994), which were tabulated in a lookup table of A versus reff 
using an inversion of a radiative transfer model (Nakajima and King 1990). This is however, 
a grey are of research and the studies for microphysical properties of clouds is replaced with 
more innovative research element of using more physically based microwave observations of 
hydrometeors in synergism with the Geostationary infrared observations. 

Step 3. Pre-calibration of Rain Rate Using Satellite Microwave Data 
After the clouds are classified for their rainno-rain baring properties, the IR radiances are to 
be calibrated against the near instantaneously collocated microwave rainfall measurements. 
The calibration with the contemporary satellites like TRMM and SSMI (whichever is 
available during IR acquisitions) would be highly desirable. TRMM is a low inclination 
tropical orbiting, while SSM/I (at present two functional) are the polar orbiting satellites. The 

Reff = ( N(r)r3dr ) / (N(r)r2 dr') 
 (5) 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

58
rainfall estimation from these satellite sensors are based on NASAs GPROF (Goddard 
Profiling) Algorithm. These are most reliable microwave satellite rainfall estimates for 
calibrating the thermal IR radiances to estimate rainfall. A large data base of collocated 
INSAT-3D IR Radiances along with TRMM/SSMI rainfall rates will be generated over 
land and oceanic regions. The retrieval of rainfall thus, would be carried out using this data 
base using multiple regression approach. The coefficients for land and oceanic regions will 
be derived separately. Over land regions the further classification would be possible only 
after extensive validations. The calibration with microwave derived rain will be dynamically 
updated in case there are changes in the rainfall products itself. 

Step 4. Moisture Availability and Sub-cloud Adjustments: 
A moisture correction factor is to be used to adjust for the tendency of the overestimation of 
precipitation in wet regions and underestimate in dry regions (Vicente et al. 1998). This 
correction factor, as first proposed by Scofield (1987) consisted of the precipitable water 
(PW, in inches) and relative humidity (RH, expressed as a decimal fraction) from the 500 
hPa to surface layer of the IMD model. The functional form of rainfall and IR brightness 
temperature relationship would be further developed under different moisture conditions. The 
relationship is adjusted by moisture factor, which is designed to modulate the evaporation 
effects on rain below cloud base for different moisture environments. The amount of 
moisture factor will also determine the growth factor along with the successive image data. 
Thus the final rainfall equations will be different for different RH and PW amounts so that 
the real time PW and RH data can be ingested properly with a priori knowledge well 
established for the region of study/operation. 
Step 5: Calibration and validation and Fine Tuning of algorithm: 
Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Doppler Weather Radar data on available 
locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. The 
error analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A 
complete error statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation 
etc.) will be performed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months). 

Step 6: Generation of Rainfall maps: 
Rainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and bigger grid spacing will be 
produced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color 
shades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, monthly 
mean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE 
from IMSRA over meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis 
System Group. Accordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and 
validation.

Step 3: Grid Average of IR TBs (0.250x0.250) to match with microwave rainfall from 
TRMM (i.e. collocation of INSAT-3D-IR-TBs and TRMM rainfall). 
Step 4: Calibration of IR brightness temperatures with the contemporary microwave 
radiometric measurements of rainfall (e.g. TRMM Rainfall from NASAs GPROF 
algorithm). 
Step 5. The IMD model based forecast of precipitable water and relative humidity for 
correction of rainfall equation based on above calibration procedure to be made available 
from IMD on every 6 hourly interval. 
Step 6: Validation and fine tuning of the algorithm based on IMDs DWR and AWS and 
fast response rain gauges on hourly basis. 
Step 7. Processing of the data for the different temporal scales (3, 6, 12 hours and etc.) 
based on the above steps of the development and validation of the algorithm. 
Remarks: 
Some of the steps like the cloud microphysics (cloud microphysics and their optical 
properties, etc.) are a grey area of research and needs experience and thus can be taken up 
only as R&D efforts. The hourly rainfall from rain gauges and DWRs and the IMD 
model forecasts from IMD in proper grid sizes (3-6 hourly, 0.5x0.5 deg. grid) are 
essential. In addition, the advanced approach suggested here to use satellite microwave 
information to augment thermal IR rainfall measurements along with VIS and WV 
would also require a large R & D effort (in terms of man hours).

4.6 
Validation 
Rainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different 
methods mentioned above. These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, 
climate, hydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an 
idea of their accuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the 
satellite precipitation estimates against "ground truth" from rain gauge and radar observations. 
A thorough verification of satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their 
accuracy in a wide range of weather and climate regimes, give users information on the 
expected errors in the estimates, help algorithm developers understand the strengths and 
weaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good estimates of absolute accuracy 
satellite products are verified against very high quality radar and gauge data. However, these 
sites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial accuracy it is necessary 
to use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain gauge networks. While 
these verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, their errors are 
usually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on short time 
scales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial scale are 
required mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges.

4.6.2 Method of Validation: 
Currently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm 
reflectivity and velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development 
of cyclones providing quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds 
within and around the storm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing 
the variations in their amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in 
polarization state, DWR quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium 
within the pulse volume. The amount of received power from the distributed target depends 
on the number of particles within the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, 
shape, orientation etc. 
 The DWRs are located at Kolkatat, Chennai, Muchlipattanm and Shri-Harikota 
(SHAR). The SHAR radar is S-band and Doppler. It is situated as an Island north of Chennai. 
All are working operationally. DWRs estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), 
Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products, 
advanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation needs. 
Ground-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISROs AWS etc), at 
high resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High 
resolution IMD DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several 
small size study sites with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for 
instance in 1x 1 degrees. The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5x 0.5 to 
2x 2 degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge 
stations over the study site and horizontal rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI 
rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain 
gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an 
hourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would be required on routine basis, 
preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5x0.5 grids. 
Pre-launch Field Experiments 
Pre-launch validation campaign will be launched for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A 
based rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D. A three months period will be selected 
(mainly rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain 
gauges and the algorithm will be tested. 
Post-Launch Special Field Experiments 
Many of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented 
for the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more 
DWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be 
utilized for the INSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the 
Sea surface temperature

validation campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual 
consultation with IMD. 
4.7 
Technical Issues: (Limitation etc.) 
The approaches for the retrieval of rainfall from these two techniques are distinctly different 
with different application areas in mind by NOAA. Thus the validity of these methods in 
Indian Tropical Regions is an important and still an open issue. For large scale rainfall GPI 
technique has been found suitable over tropical regions and can be implented. 
However, the inherent limitations of IR / VIS based methods due to their indirect 
measurements poses challenges for the accuracy of the rainfall products. More importantly 
GMSRA is the algorithms, which is a large effort from various scientific institutions put 
together for many years and then integrated at NOAA. To follow them for the algorithm 
development directly over tropical regions of India needs a lot of R & D, experience and 
innovations pertaining to the region. It is because, some of the steps like the cloud 
microphysics (estimation of effective radius of cloud particles, their optical properties etc.) 
and associated parameters estimation are the important but grey areas of research and can be 
accomplished fully only with the R&D efforts and experience in the field. 
In addition the GMSRA, however, is a highly specific to US regions particularly with very 
large spatial and temporal coverages of the background data of Doppler Weather Radars (as 
a dominant characteristics of the algorithm) along with the satellite data. In case of GMSRA, 
some of the efforts are highly innovative (optical and cloud microphysics) and as mentioned 
earlier we have proposed to alternatively apply some some advanced elements in our 
proposed IMSRA algorithm, so that the method is more prone to Indian tropical regions. 
However, the advanced approach suggested here to use microwave information from most 
recent satellites like low/polar orbiting TRMM/SSM/I to augment thermal IR rainfall 
measurements along with VIS and WV channels from Geostationary satellite would also 
require large R & D efforts. 
4.8 
Future Scope 
Due to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earths surface it is important that 
corrections be applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes. 
Conventional means are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite 
measurements are now commonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent 
observations from visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that 
estimates of precipitation are indirect and therefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to 
surface rainfall variations. More direct measurements of precipitation through the use of 
passive microwave (PMW) instruments are somewhat restricted due their relative infrequent 
sampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms for merging of microwave data with IR 
images to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal resolutions of the IR sensor is 
highly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall estimates using the temporal 
sampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the microwave estimates, avoiding 
the mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At present we have proposed 
to use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves for the rainfall 
estimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground truth. In 
future this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and microwave 
Sea surface temperature

measurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall than 
any of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone.

Introduction 
Rainfall affects the lives and economies of a majority of the Earth's population. Rain systems, 
such as hurricanes, typhoons, monsoons, and fronts are crucial to sustaining the livelihood of 
many countries. Excess rainfall can cause flood, property and crop damages. A deficiency 
causes drought and crop failure. Flood is a disaster that often resulted from intense 
precipitation in short time. Floods are among the most devastating national hazards in the 
world, claiming more lives and causing more property damage than any other natural 
phenomena. Within the USA an average of more than 225 people are killed and more than 
$3.5 billion in property is damaged by heavy rain and flooding each year (1993, 1999). 
These figures are more devastating for India with population over 1 billion. As of today, the 
floods is one the greatest challenges in weather prediction. 
Conventionally rainfall over the ground is measured using rain gauges and radar. Rain 
gauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of the 
precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of the rain 
gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of various 
rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, etc. On the 
other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their coverage is limited due 
to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to poor calibration of radar 
reflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous 
propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based 
observation network often failed to work. In view of the limitations of the ground 
measurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large area is by 
using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer frequent uniform coverage over large 
area. However, the satellite measurements also suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR 
methods suffer from their inability to sense hydrometeors (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), 
microwave measurements suffer due to so called beam filling problem, and uncertainty in the 
drop-size distribution, drop temperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops 
(Varma et al, 2003, 2004 and Varma and Liu, 2006).

In this document, a new most advanced method is described for precipitation measurement. 
This method called Hydro-Estimator (H-E) method is developed by Robert Kuligowaski 
utilizes the infrared (IR) measurements from a geostationary satellite and is operationally 
used at NOAA/NESDIS. 
4.2.1 Overview and Background 
Scofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense precipitation over a storm. His 
method called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) that used half-hourly satellite images 
to measure the precipitation over the active area of a storm. His method utilized the skill of a 
trained meteorologist to find out active portion of a storm. His method also utilized the 
precipitable water (PW) and water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for 
dry/wet environment and saturation level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm 
clouds. This method was very successful for precipitation measurement but was highly 
subjective and needed continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the 
precipitation amount. Due to this reason, it was not very easy to implement it with ease. 
Successively, an alternate method called Auto-Estimator was developed. The aim of the 
Auto-Estimator was to provide an automated method without human intervention and that 
could take care of the subjective nature of the IFFA, but this method a failed on many 
occasions because many features of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-
Estimator is most recent of the attempts by NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated. 
The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not present in IFFA or were 
defined differently. 
Till date there is no published literature on H-E method is available (or known to us). The 
method/procedure described in this document is based on pre-prints of a paper and personal 
communication with Dr. Robert Kuligowaski who pioneered in developing H-E method at 
NOAA/NESDIS. 
4.2.2 Objectives:

region encompassing area between longitudes 30 E -to130 E and latitudes 50 N -

4.4.1 Overview: 
4.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
Physical explanation of rainfall estimation from Visible and IR images 
The most satellite rainfall monitoring methods seek to: 
1. Identify areas of probable precipitation, through recognition of most rain/no-rain 
boundaries 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

70
2. Evaluate associated rainrate 
3. Combine (1) and (2) through time where estimates of total accumulated rainfall are 
required 
The objective of present day satellite research is blending of different types of data, from 
both satellite and non-satellite sources, into the `best possible rainfall product. 
Rainfall estimation using Visible and IR satellite rainfall algorithm - physical premise 
1. In the visible region of the spectrum the basic physical assumption is that cloud 
brightness is an indicator of cloud thickness, and this inturn is an indicator of rainfall. 
Unfortunately these relationships are neither simple nor constant; for example, because 
by no means all bright clouds precipitate. 
2. In the thermal IR, the basic physical premise is that cloud top temperature is a function of 
cloud top height, and that higher and colder cloud tops evidence thicker clouds which are 
more likely to rain. While this set of relationship is more often true than (1) above, 
unfortunately not all cold clouds precipitate, nor does rain always come from cold clouds. 

Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images 

The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the 
atmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated 
over all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of 
temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium 
emits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, 
than a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determines its 
emission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is 
related to its physical temperature is T by following equation: 
Tb = T 
where, is emissivity of the object. If. = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if = 0, Tb = 0, its a 
white body; if 0 < < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. 
The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a 
atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In 
this band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous 
constituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, 
measured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those 
surfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated 
by effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will 
be referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be 
measured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be 
unity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called 
`brightness temperature. Only when = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body 
temperature. 
The value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of 
lapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with 
height, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be 
infrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this

context, because < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). 
The more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometrelly thick 
but are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds that extend into lower 
troposphere. 
Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images 
In middle and late fifties and earlier sixties, various researches concluded that with thicker 
clouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest 
for clouds warmer than -15 C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall. 
The possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet growth rates. 
In clouds warmer than -15 C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large cloud 
thickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However, the 
other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also important. 
Difference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds were attributed 
to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and difference in 
evaporation below the cloud base. Very high droplet concentrations (> 400 cm3) inhibit 
coalescence and formation of rain. The evaporation of raindrops is proportional to saturation 
vapor deficit and fall period. Both droplet concentration and subcloud moisture and thickness 
are more variable over land than over water. Temperature governs various processes. At 
temperature -10 C growth of hydrometeors is dominated by sublimation and collisions 
involving ice particles; that is, by Wegener-Bergeron rather than coalescence processes. Less 
important factors influencing precipitation are condensation nuclei, updraft speed, and 
electrification. Thus cloud thickness, though important, is one of the several factors 
determining production of rain in the clouds. 
Various researchers have tried to related cloud thickness with satellite observed brightness. 
The contradictory claims are made. Some of them have found high correlation between two, 
where as others could not notice so encouraging results with their studies. It is concluded that 
cloud brightness alone cannot always imply cloud thickness. In more than one instance, 
Erickson and Hubert (1961) found in their study that large thunderstorms having vertical 
depths of the order of 30000 feet appeared no brighter, than a rather dense overcast of much 
smaller vertical extent. 
 The understanding of the factors governing cloud brightness is complicated as it is a 
problem of optics that again requires an excursion into the theory of electromagnetic 
radiation. 
The light scattering from water clouds can be described as a problem of effect of light 
scattering by particles of size comparable or slightly more than the wavelength of the 
incident light. For water clouds, the particles (or droplets) may vary in size (the number of 
particles as a function of their size), and the cloud geometry is variable (the arrangement of 
particles in relation to the incident beam of solar radiation). This problem is generally treated 
in two parts: single scattering and multiple scattering. 
The single scattering theory describes the fate of incident light in a very small part of a 
natural cloud. The aggregate effect on the incident beam of all parts of a cloud is treated 
through the theory of multiple scattering. Here, the dimensions of the cloud and its 
orientation with respect to a given incident beam become important.

Twomey et al. (1967) calculated reflectance as a function of geometric thickness for a cloud 
drop distribution of 6 m average radius and 1 m standard deviation. Liquid water content 
was 0.2 and 0.4 gm- 3, and two solar zenith angles were considered. They found that 
reflectance increases rapidly in hyperbolic fashion for both values of liquid water content, 
implying little additional increase above the thickness of 0.7 km. The effect of absorption 
was to increase the rate of hyperbolic convergence. Changing solar zenith angle had little 
effect (though at large zenith angles reflectance would approach unity), and the effects on 
reflectance of changing drop size distribution radius and variance were small for optical 
thickness, > 100. 

The radiance (brightness) from the striated cloud is larger than plan parallel radiance in 
antisolar direction with inclined illumination (Wending, 1977). Wending tested two drop size 
distributions, one peaking at r ~ 5 m and other at 5 ~ 2 m, both appropriate to stratus 
clouds. The difference in albedo and radiance at small zenith angles were comparable to 
differences resulting from geometry of the cloud top; however, these also decreased with 
increasing optical thickness. Therefore, at optical thickness typical of precipitating clouds, 
texture and drop size distribution may be of secondary importance in explaining cloud 
brightness. McKee and Klehr (1978) with their RT (radiative transfer) model found that 
cloud geometry is far more important factor than drop size distribution. 

A composite picture emerging out of various studies in the past has proved the main factors 
governing cloud brightness are: 
 thickness 
 the area to volume ratio 
 orientation of solar beam 

These factors collectively called geometry, determine optical path within the cloud. Drop size 
distribution and liquid water content are secondary in importance. Background albedo may 
be significant over land areas. Interactions apparently are important when clouds are close 
together. The phase is not appears to be an important variable. 

The proposed method is the H-E method as developed at NOAA/NESDIS. The details of 
this method are described in the next section. 
Retrieval Algorithm Method 
The H-E method described in this section is based on pre-prints of a paper by Kuligowaski et 
al. (2003). This paper is received from the author through personal communication. 

The H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-E 
method, the relationship between 10.7 m brightness temperature (Tb10.7) and rain rate (mm 
h-1) (R) is defined as: 

R = a exp(-bTb
12
10.7), -----(1) 

Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

73
where, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 
(Vicente et al. 1995). The A-E method provides same relationship for convective and non-
convective precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value. 

In H-E method, convective and non-convective cores are identified and different R-Tb 
relationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the convective 
cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and 
b are varied as per precipitable water (PW) provided by Eta model. This allows higher 
precipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained such a way that it 
yields a value of 0.5 mm h-1 of rain rate at 240 K, and a precipitable water (from Eta model) 
dependent value at 210 K of Tb10.7. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain value at any 
pixel is limited depending upon availability of PW. This allows the maximum precipitation to 
become a function of available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm h-1 is 
given as 40 times the precipitable water in inches. 

If a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In principle, 
the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are 
recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at 
the lowest temperature in the vicinity. 

Foa a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb10.7 and Rs is given as: 

Rs=(250-Tb10.7) * (Rmax/5) -----------------(2) 

Rmax is again a function of PW. The relationship between Rmax and PW is not known in this 
case and needs to be determined. Rs is not allowed to exceed - corresponding convective rain 
rate (Rc) or 12 mm h-1, whichever is lower. 

The relationship between Eta model derived PW and R (in mm h-1) at 210 K is shown in 
figure 1(a). The figures 1 (b) and 1(c) shows the relationship between R and Tb10.7 at 
different PW values for convective and non-convective cores, respectively. These figures are 
taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowaski et al. (2003). 

In H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is allowed to be combination of both convective 
and non-convective core. This is worked out by considering a pixel box of 101X101 pixels 
surrounding the pixel of interest. The minimum, mean and standard deviation of Tb10.7 (Tmin ), 
in this pixel box is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual region of interest. 
Within this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation () of Tbm10.7 is 
determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel is determined 
through the parameter Z, which is defined as: 
Z = (Tmean- Tb10.7)/ ----------(3) 
The maximum allowable value of Z is 1.5. 

If Z < 0; R = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective 
Otherwise, RR = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3) 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

74
Rc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW from 
Eta model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the pixel rain rate RR 
reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if Z=0, the pixel rain rate 
RR is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). 

 In fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, and 
hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. Thus, this 
same computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, and the final rain 
rate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to this is if the rain rate 
computed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not considered in the final rain 
rate calculation. 

The (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus estimated 
is further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and also for the 
precipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved for such 
modifications are as follows: 

(a) Correction for Wet/dry Environment 
A small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb10.7) values is carried out to account for 
wetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of the 
precipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the 
brightness temperature at 10.7m is set for dry or wetter environment. This is carried out in 
two steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the PW value to 
compute rain rate from (3). This is shown in Fig. 2 (a), where brightness temperature 
correction is additive or subtractive depends upon value of PW. In the second step, first, the 
(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003)) 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

75
RH itself from the Eta model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then depending 
upon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made. Fig. 2(b) shows the 
correction of RH as a function of rain. Fig. 2(c) shows the correction rain amount as a 
function of corrected RH. 

(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003)) 

(b) Warm-top modification 

The equilibrium level is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward 
(from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the 
environmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the 
temperatures of the convective tops with that of equilibrium level. This level comes before 
tropopause for the warm rain. 

In H-E method, Eta model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine 
equilibrium temperature of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels that are 
warmer than the equilibrium level temperature. 

 If the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb10.7 of the 
pixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows: 

Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

76
Tb10.7 [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less) 
 If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows 
Tb10.7 [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) 

(c) Orography and Parallax correction 

Orography adjustment is carried out using 850 hPa Winds and topography from a digital 
elevation model at 4 km resolution to derive vertical component of wind (Vicente et al., 
2002). This vertical wind component is then scaled into a multiplicative adjustment to the 
rain rate. 
The parallax correction described in the same paper, adjusts the horizontal location of the 
satellite pixel prior to rain rate computation, based on cloud height (using Tb and standard 
atmosphere) and satellite zenith angle. 
Satellite Zenith angle correction is carried out to take into accounts the increased path length 
at higher angles. A technique developed by Joyce et al. (2001) is used.

4.6.1 Validation of weekly Met-subdivision rain: 
We have computed the H-E rain from modified algorithm for 10 week period from 3 July to 
10 September 2014. The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly basis and 
compared with rain values provided by IMD in Weakly Weather Report (WWR). A scatter 
plot of comparison is shown in Fig. 3 below. 

The Fig. 3 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the week-by-
week comparison statistics is provided in Table 1.6.1 below.

If we compare Table 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, we may conclude that overall (with all 10 weeks of 
dataset) correlation of WWR with H-E is same as that with TRMM 3B42 V7. The rms 
difference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of 
these similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, the 
correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, whereas 
that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high value of 0.93. 
Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that between TRMM

3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-E is also attempted 
and is shown in the Table 1.6.2. 

4.6.2 Validation of daily 0.25ox0.25o grided rain 
The comparisons in section 4.6.1 are carried out in weekly meteorological sub-division scales. The 
rain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few seconds to any 
time scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random stochastic process. Therefore, rain 
comparisons in shorter time scales and from observations in different spatial scales lead to large 
errors (Piyush et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from 
modified H-E method with gridded dataset from IMD. The comparisons of H-E and 3B42 V7 are 
carried out with IMD gridded dataset for each of the met subdivisions as provided in Table 1.6.3 to 
table 1.6.4.

A comparison of rain from modified H-E and TRMM-3B42 V7 in 0.25ox0.25o degree in each 
met subdivision is shown in Table 1.6.5, which shows significantly higher correlations and 
smaller rmse for most of the regions. This is mainly due to spatially averaged measurement 
of rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 1.6.5 also shows the performance 
of modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be noted here that 
neither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset provides measurements over oceans. So the 
comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing the quality of H-E rain 
over oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from H-E and 
3B42 V7 has a good agreement over oceans with correlation of 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 
mm/day. If all area including land and oceans including and surrounding India are taken into 
consideration, the correlation and rmse between H-E and TRMM-3B42 V7 is 0.59 and rmsd 
of 22.44 mm/day.

The validation results provided here indicate reasonably good agreement of INSAT-3D H-E 
rain with surface observations. The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm are 
able to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to suffer 
from huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and its validation 
in smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). The results 
presented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison results of the global 
standard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a recent study by Tan et al. 
(2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution precipitation products including TRMM-
3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that among 5 satellite based rain products, the 
3B42 V7 and is the best performing with respect to surface observations, which on daily 
scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much 
more diverse surface and climatic conditions with different cloud types and wide range of 
precipitation rates during S-W months, we achieve much higher correlation between 
modified H-E rain with surface observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E 
vis--vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC 
sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D 
H-E is available within 15 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for 
operational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting 
and numerical weather predictions. 
4.7 
Future Scope 
The scheme has to be regularly calibrated with more varied calibration data. Further merging 
of H-E with microwave observations is desired for more accrate rain measurement.

Introduction 
ISRO is launching INSAT-3D geostationary satellite in 2007/8. The inheritance of 
this satellite has come from GOES series of NOAA. Meteorological payloads onboard 
would be a 6 channel imager and a 19 channel sounder mainly for cyclone and monsoon 
monitoring, cloud motion vectors winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation 
monitoring, snow cover detection, mesoscale studies etc. 19 channel Sounder, split 
thermal window channels, a mid IR thermal window channel and shortwave IR channel 
are the additions to earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana satellites. Details of Imager channels are 
given in Table-1. 
Sea surface temperature would be derived from split thermal window channels (10.2-
11.3m, 11.5 12.5m) during daytime and using additional mid IR window channel (3.7 
 4.1m) during nighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of 
the SST retrieval from IR observations is the atmospheric correction. Specially over 
tropics, this atmospheric correction is dominated by the high variability in vertical 
distribution of the intervening atmospheric water vapor. This correction will be 
determined through suitable characterization of tropical atmospheres in radiative transfer 
model to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D channels and then 
generating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have 
been given in section 1.4.1.1. 

5.2.1 Overview and background 
This algorithm basis theoretical document (ATBD) describes our current working 
models of the algorithms for the retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D 
imager channels data. While effort has been made to make this document as complete as

possible, it should be recognized that algorithm development is an evolving process. This 
document (V1.0) is a description of the prototype algorithm for INSAT-3D sea surface 
temperature estimation as it currently exists, and is being delivered for inclusion in the 
INSAT-3D processing scheme. 
Current research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the 
processes at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite 
will lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear 
incomplete in places as research continues to improve our understanding of the processes 
at work. Subsequent revisions of the document will reflect new knowledge and, it is 
hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here.

5.4.1 Overview 
5.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
Radiance from Earths terrestrial emission peaks at around 9.6 m and it has 
minimum absorption by atmospheric gases, hence in order to measure earths temperature, 
spaceborne sensors are designed around this band (8-12m). Still this band is not 
completely transparent. Atmospheric water vapour and CO2 are the major components 
that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of the atmosphere. Since CO2 is a 
uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be taken care, but water vapour being highly variable 
its effect can only be removed by its measurement(directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea 
surface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires 
atmospheric corrections arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This 
correction is more in tropics during summers due to higher amount of atmospheric 
moisture (Barton 1983, Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 
1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). Our radiative transfer simulations studies have shown that 
with proper characterization of tropical marine conditions in the atmosphere, a suitable 
algorithm can be developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal 
window and mid IR thermal channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K. 
The regression equation to correct for atmospheric absorption and emission has the form 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

90

SST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2 

(1) 
Where A0, A1, A2 and A3 are coefficients determined by simulation and may have satellite 
zenith angle dependence 
 dT = T11 T12 
 T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels. 

To determine the regression coefficients in the above equation, radiative transfer 
simulations to generate INSAT-3D channels brightness temperatures for Indian marine 
tropical environmental conditions would be carried out. The important step in regression 
is to ensure that the sample dataset is fully and solely representative of the population for 
which the SST is to be derived. Instrument noise in simulated data for INSAT-3D 
channels would be introduced as per the availability from sensor team. 
A case study for SST retrieval using GOES-9 data (19th August 2005) yielded 0.68 K 
RMS deviation. 
5.4.1.1.1 Radiative Transfer Model 
To simulate the brightness temperatures, MODTRAN is being used. MODTRAN is a 
computer code developed by Spectral Sciences Inc. and is designed to determine 
atmospheric transmittance and radiance at moderate resolution (1 cm-1). It is based on 
AFGLs LOWTRAN-7 code. Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset has 
been used to construct the tropical marine subset. These profiles have been extracted 
from 500 S 500 N and 300E 1200E. The simulations have been performed on each 
radio sounding of the TIGR "tropical maritime" subset under the following conditions: 
-TIGR profiles are available on 48 levels. They have been converted to the 34 level 
MODTRAN inputs by using directly the TIGR levels from the surface to 300 hPa (15 
levels), sampling every 4 levels above 300 hPa (5 levels are excluded this way) and 
removing the upper 9 levels. 
-In addition to the profiles of temperature and water vapor of TIGR, mixed gases profiles 
from MODTRAN standard atmospheres have been added according to the time and 
location of each radiosounding. 
-No aerosols have been considered. 
-Satellite zenith angles: 4 values of the secant have been retained: 1., 1.5, 1.75, 2. This 
sampling aims to detect possible non linearities in the dependance of any given quantity 
in function of sec(). 
-Surface temperatures: For each radio sounding 3 surface temperatures have been 
assigned: Ta1000 (1000 mb air temperature), Ta1000+1C, Ta1000-1C. 
-Radiances have been simulated for INSAT-3A and INSAT-3D thermal channels (i.e. 
10.5-12.5 m, 10.3-11.3 m, 11.5-12.5 m, 3.7-4.1 m) with emissivity values 
calculated from the tables of Masuda 1988 with a moderate wind speed of 5 ms-1 (see 
table 1 below). They have been calculated for each channel as means of tabulated values 
at the central and neighbouring wavelengths to account for the width of the filter function. 
For instance, emissivities for channels centred on 11 m were calculated as the mean 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

91
values of emissivities at 10.5 and 11 m, etc. They were then interpolated in function of 
sec() and used with a step of 0.0025 induced. 
Radiances will be integrated for each channel with the filter functions provided by Sensor 
Group and converted into radiative temperatures. 
The simulations applied on the "tropical maritime" subset of TIGR produced 5820 cases. 
Before being used to derive algorithms, the simulated radiative temperatures were filtered. 
To keep the simulated temperatures within realistic limits, the following thresholds were 
finally applied on the simulation file: 
Ts-T11 > 0.5C 
-2C < Ts < 35C 
W > 0.5 g/cm2 

5.4.1.1.2 Inversion Methods 
To generate regression coefficients from the simulated brightness temperatures as per the 
form prescribed in equation (1), multiple regression using least square method will be 
adopted. 

5.4.1.1.3 Single Channel SST retrieval 
In case of failure in any one of the thermal split channels, provisions are provided to 
retrieve SST using single functional channel (water vapour correction in that case will be 
carried out by ingesting total water vapour content externally from model output, and 
applying water vapour dependent SST coefficients similar to SST retrieval from INSAT-
3A/Kalpana data). If external total WV conetent is not available, climatological water 
vapor will be used. 
Single channel SST is computed as 
SST = a + b*Tb +c*WV 
 Where 
Tb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water vapour content, 
a, b and c are regression coefficients generated through radiative transfer simulations and 
may have satellite zenith angle dependence. 
 5.4.1.1.4 Cloud Detection 
In the present algorithm, cloudy pixels are detected through thresholding and spatial 
coherence techniques in thermal band and the pixels are rejected based on the above 
criterion. Thresholding technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness 
temperature in thermal band is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in 
decreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

92
based on the assumption that SST is homogeneous and warmer than clouds; thus clouds 
can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value or larger 
standard deviation. Further, the cloud flags generated by cloud mask routine will be used 
to detect the clouds. SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. 

5.4.1.1.5 Error analysis 
The uncertainty in the INSAT-3D SST retrieval is straightforward to calculate. Taking 
equation (1) and performing an error analysis, one sees that the error in SST can be 
represented 
as: 

where et is the total error, ai are the estimation coefficients, and ei is the error apparent 
for each band i used in the algorithm. ei is given by 

with eia being the error due to atmospheric correction and NETi deriving from instrumental 
design and performance considerations. Since the constants ai are order 1, and one assumes 
that the nadir and/or atmospheric errors are comparable and the various bands have similar 
characteristics, one can see the error scales as 

where n is the number of bands used. 
This analysis makes clear the fact that calibration and/or atmosphere correction errors are 
important components of the error budget, i.e., 0.1K of error in calibration for a band is 
effectively an rms error in a dual band algorithm of 0.14K, assuming perfect atmospheric 
correction. Therefore, we have requested that the calibration be demonstrably accurate at 
the choice of 0.05K level to minimize the effect of calibration errors. The best 
atmospheric correction currently available for ATSR suggests that errors due to 
atmospheric correction in optimal cases for a nadir viewing instrument are approximately 
0.3K [Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1990; Barton, et al., 1993; Minnett, 1995b]. 
If one assumes that the calibration errors and the atmospheric errors are random and thus 
can be RSSd, as in the preceding analysis, one sees that expected errors of 0.35K-0.4K 
in the result are the best that can be expected for two-band configurations. This equation 
also points out that there is a cost associated with adding more bands to improve 
atmospheric correction. In addition to providing information potentially useful for 
correcting the effects of the intervening atmosphere, each additional band also introduces 
noise into the SST retrieval.

5.4.3 Operational Implementation 
Step-1. Determine radiances using the processed Imager data and convert radiances 
to temperature using lookup table. 
Step-2. Processing for discrimination between radiances from cloud free sea surface 
and those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 1.4.1.1.4 
Step-3. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is taken care in SST computation for 
multichannel SST retrieval, but in case of availability of only one thermal 
channel, total water vapour field will be required externally from model 
output. 
Step-4. Computation of SST 

 During daytime, for cloud free pixels, SST is computed as 
SST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2 
Where A0, A1, A2, and A3 are coefficients determined by regression and 
may have satellite zenith angle dependence. 

 dT = T11 T12 
T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels 
During Nighttime, for cloud free pixels, SST is computed as 
SST= A0 + A1T3 + A2dT + A3dT2 
Where A0, A1, A2, and A3 are coefficients determined by regression and 
may have satellite zenith angle dependence. 

 dT = T11 T12 
T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels and 
T3 is the brightness temperature for channel 3 of IMAGER. 
Single channel SST is computed as 

SST = a + b*Tb +c*WV 
Where 
Tb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water 
vapour content, a, b and c are regression coefficients generated through 
radiative transfer simulations and may have satellite zenith angle dependence.

Step-5. Quality control/Editing of derived SSTs. 
Satellite data are flagged 3(highest quality SST) if the absolute difference 
between the satellite SST and the climatology is strictly below 30 C and 
the channel 5 standard deviation is lower or equal to 10 C. If both the 
criterion are not true, flag value is put as 2. In case of cloudy pixel, flag 
value is 1. Pixels over land are flagged as 4.

5.6 Validation 
Validation of the derived SST will be done using all the available data from buoys, 
special cruise by ORV SagarKanya and available similar products from various 
satellite missions. Validation will be jointly done with IMD. 

5.6.1 Data required 
Buoy or ship data for SST validation should consists of following parameter 
 SHIP/Buoy ID 
 Location of the measurement 
 Time of the measurement 
 SurfaceWind speed and direction 
 Surface Relative humidity 
 SST 
 Depth at which measurement is taken 
 Instrument accuracy of SST. 

5.6.2 Methods of validation 
The in situ records are first temporally matched-up against the INSAT extractions. To 
limit variability introduced by the time separation between the two data sources, the 
Sea surface temperature 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

96
absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at 
which that location is viewed by the INSAT (i.e., the matchup time window) is restricted 
to a maximum of 30 minutes or 15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the 
stipulated time window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal 
matchup subsequently have to pass a spatial test. A maximum distance of 0.1 will be 
accepted between an in situ SST location and the location of the central pixel in the 
INSAT extraction box. 
Measurement quality control: The climatological SST is then calculated for this box by 
spatial averaging and time interpolation. If the absolute value of the difference between 
the in situ measurement and the climatology is strictly below 20C the box is included into 
the database. 

5.6.3 
Technical issues (limitation etc.) 

Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to 
simulate the satellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in 
radiative transfer model simulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST 
with reliable and concurrent insitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel 
observations and a channel sensitive to intervening atmospheric total water vapour 
content, the atmospheric correction applied is an indirect. The accuracy of this correction 
will heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model reanalysis for total water vapour. 
Major constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort focus in the following 
areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NET for each band, 
calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-
validation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, 
and timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit 
instrument NET performance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget. 

5.7 Future Scope 
Initially, prelaunch algorithm would be used to derive SST. Over a period of 
approximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias 
correction and other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should 
improve the accuracy of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also 
plays a crucial role in determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of 
regression coefficients for SST retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy 
observations data base require nearly 250 buoys distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of 
Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 years.

Snow Cover Mapping 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Algorithms will be developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D Meteorological payload. 
The snow mapping algorithm will use a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized 
Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-
by-pixel basis, and to map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow 
mapping, as it reflects strongly in the visible region than in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of 
the spectrum. In addition, the reflectance of clouds remains high in the short-wave IR, while 
the reflectance of snow is considerably low. 
Validation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data 
of Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will 
also be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS snow maps. The accuracy of 
the snow maps will vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snowmap algorithm has been and 
will continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined 
from field measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the 
expected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the 
algorithm. 
6.2 
Introduction 
6.2.1 Overview and background 
The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product 
from INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used 
successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days 
snow covered digital map products will be generated. 
Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere 
winter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation 
balance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow 
during wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can 
affect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher 
Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase 
in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et 
Snow cover

al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important 
parameter for various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of 
snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche investigation. 
Snow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, 
the potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development 
of higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, 
satellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been 
used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al. 2006). This is possibly 
due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared 
region. Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for 
snowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been 
extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of 
numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis techniques as 
visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate areal extent 
of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow cover 
monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow and 
confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of 
above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is 
needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time 
consuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is 
developed and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as 
compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow 
reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on 
satellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has 
been effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover 
mapping (Hall et al. 1995). 
6.2.1.1 
Remote Sensing of Snow Cover 
One of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. 
During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was 
carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was 
extensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the 
Himalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004). 
This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and 
availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA 
satellite. In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was 
necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally 
make it difficult to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of 
March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised 
classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in 
Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). 
Another major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded 
due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between 
snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, 
association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present 
Snow cover 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

103
investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows 
characteristic mountainous pattern, which can not be seen when area is cloud covered. In 
visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore 
discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance 
characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-
3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows 
lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has been successfully 
used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006). 
Reflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but 
decreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren 
and Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution 
becomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance 
snowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and 
other factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over 
time. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) 
up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow 
crystals metamorphose. 
Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The 
reflectance from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly 
fallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the 
specular component characteristic of forward scattering increases. 
6.2.2 
Objective 
The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product 
from INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index 
method, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. 
Daily snow and maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated. 
This algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness 
temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively 
(Romanov et al, 2003).

6.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
6.4.1 Overview 
A grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the 
algorithm was selected for the following reasons: 
1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat-1. Its accuracy has 
been tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared 
from other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps of 
MODIS data. 
2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar 
illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as 
Himalayas (Kulkarni et. al. 2006). 
3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial 
resolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel 
number 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be 
generated at 1 km resolution. 
4) The algorithm will be further improved using NDVI and brightness temperature to 
identify snow under forest and cloud, respectively. In addition, Spectral range of band 
1 of INSAT 3 D and AWiFS band 2 are different, threshold values needs to be

evaluated. This will be initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of 
Space Applications Centre and then sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D data. 
5) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, 
computationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the 
product is generated. 
Snow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The 
Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from 
many other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A 
similar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been 
proven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year 
(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished 
using the NDSI. 
Other promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, 
spectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be 
usable for automatic application at the mountainous region. They are also computationally 
intensive. Training or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application 
of techniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional 
applications and possibly even global application in future years. 
6.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
6.4.1.1.1 Snow cover map 
The snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A 
regional, daily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will 
be generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield 
maximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit 
during that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free 
on all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics 
will also be included to assist analysis of the data product. 
There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow 
maps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the 
NOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer 
composition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this 
period optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological 
data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If 
a researcher wants to produce a composite product for any period other than a 10-day period, 
from our daily product, this can be done using the daily data. 
6.4.1.1.2 
Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) 
The NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus 
clouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance 
difference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is 
insensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al., 2006). The NDSI is 
analogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; 
Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI can be computed as given below; 
Snow cover 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

106

NDSI = (VisibleINSAT B1 - SWIRINSAT B2) / (VisibleINSAT B1 + SWIRINSAT B2) 
Pixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI 
values more than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi 
et. al., 2006). These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous 
AWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. 
(Kulkarni et. al, 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are 
mixed in a pixel. Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure 
snow can be distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006). Since Bandwidth of 
AWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D imager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be 
established using Field Spectral Data Library of Space Applications Centre (Singh, et. al., 
2005 and Negi, et. al., 2006). This will be further evaluated during post launch period, by 
carrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et. al. 2006). 
In forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly 
classify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et. al., 
2006). NDVI and NDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and 
snow covered forests. Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested 
pixels. Thus by using the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI 
threshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance for other land 
covers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be 
generated using AWiFS sensor. 
The NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values 
observed in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested 
pixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, 
yet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., 
1998). 
Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate 
water from snow. 
6.4.1.1.3 
Snow / Cloud Discrimination 
Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow 
reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by 
their generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic 
spectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave 
infrared part of the spectrum. 
While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify 
or discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data 
show that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds 
have high reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold 
value and will be used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will 
further be improved due to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D Met payload. 
Appropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow 
(Romanov, et. al., 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product 
subject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D derived product. This will be additional 
criteria than in build criteria of NDSI.

6.4.1.1.5 
Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold 
In order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, a sensitivity 
test of individual threshold values were carried out. NDSI threshold values were changed 
from 0 to 1 at an interval of 0.05. If pixel is having NDSI value equal or more than threshold 
value then it is classified as snow. Then loss in areal extent due to increase in threshold value 
are converted into percent and plotted on Y-axis . X-axis indicate NDSI threshold. In general, 
areal extent decreases as NDSI value increases from 0 to 1. But amount of change varies 
from constant to rapid. In case of AWiFS scene of winter, constant drop in area in the order 
of 3% was observed as threshold value changes from 0 to 0.4. After threshold of 0.4 drop in 
area (Snow pixels) is moderate to rapid. Visual analysis suggests that all snow cover areas 
including snow in forest and mountain shadow can be mapped if threshold value is 0.4. In 
order to establish validity of this observation, the similar investigations were carried out from 
December to May at an interval of one month. The NDSI threshold will be fine tuned after 
the availability of INSAT 3D derived snow cover product. 
6.4.2 Operational Implementation 
6.4.1.2 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: 
In this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and 
Brightness temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D 
data. The radiometrically processed data will also be geolocated and this will 
provide a radiometrically and geometrically corrected product to be used further 
in algorithm. 
6.4.1.3 Step 2 : Cloud elimination 
This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D image. Cloud 
screening is based on temperature data/or cloud mask along with cloud removal 
using SWIR threshold value, and will help to clear cloudy pixels. 
6.4.1.4 Step 3 : Generation of NDSI image 
Normalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio 
of visible and SWIR channel as given below; 
NDSI = (R INSAT B1 R INSAT B2) / (R INSAT B1 R INSAT B2) 
Where R is the reflectance of the respective channel.

6.6 Validation and Error Analysis 
6.6.1 Validation Activities 
6.6.1.1 Comparison of INSAT 3D snow maps with AWiFS and MODIS operational 
snow maps 
INSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated 
by AWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of 
Snowmap results with these independently-produced snow data sets will allow errors to be 
identified that will permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one 
another. There are several hemispheric-scale satellite-derived snow-cover maps available, but 
none has been fully validated. 
6.6.1.2. Mapping Snow in Densely-Forested Areas 
A significant limitation in mapping the extent of snow cover occurs in situations of mixed 
pixels where snow cover is obscured by dense forest cover. The snow covered forested 
landscape is actually never completely snow covered because the tree branches, trunks and 
canopies often do not get or stay snow covered. Often, in boreal forests, snow that falls on 
the coniferous tree canopy will not stay on the canopy for the entire winter due to 
sublimation. Thus, even in a continuously snow covered area, much of the forested landscape 
will not be snow covered. It may be very difficult, even with field measurements and high-
resolution air photos, to determine what percentage of the area is snow covered. Additionally, 
when viewing at off-nadir angles the tree branches, canopies, etc., will obscure even more of 
the snow than when viewing at near-nadir angles. 
Dense forests cover much of the Earths land surface. Snow accumulates to greater depths 
and melts later in the spring in the boreal forests than in adjacent areas (Foster et al., 1991). 
Though the boreal forests are always snow covered in the winter, within dense forests, snow 
that falls onto the ground through the canopy may not be visible from above. Some snow 
stays in the tree canopy and may thus be visible, but the snow often does not stay in the 
canopy during the entire winter. Snow in trees often sublimates before falling to the ground. 
Therefore, NDSI values will be appropriately modified to identify snow under forest cover. 
6.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow cover Mapping 
It is recognized that NDSI will perform better in some land covers than in others. Specifically, 
results using the NDSI algorithm with AWiFS data above snow line show 100 percent snow 
cover when they were known by field measurements to be 100 percent snow covered. In 
forested areas, errors may be much larger. 
An estimate of the errors inherent in using Snow cover map in different land covers will be 
made using data from focused field missions, for example: agricultural (e.g. in the Kullu 
district.), forest free (e.g. Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh), forest (e.g. Forested 
region of Beas basin), Errors have been determined for the following land covers: forests, 
mixed agriculture and forest, barren/sparsely-vegetated, shrub land, wetlands, and glacial 
region. These land covers were selected because they cover a wide range of conditions 
encountered in snow covered parts of the Himalaya.

temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Algorithms needs be developed to estimate snow depth using INSAT 3D Met payload. 
Important step in estimation of snow depth is generation of snow fraction map. Since 
Himalayan region is highly mountainous, the data processing would initially need calibration, 
georeferencing, atmospheric correction, snow pixel detection, cloud masking, local 
illumination angle correction, diffuse radiation correction, BDRF correction and 
orthorectification. This will be followed by Linear or non-linear mixing modeling to 
estimate snow fraction in each pixel. The mixing modeling would need large spectral 
reflectance library of snow and other land features of Himalayan region, to identify end 
members of snow and snow free terrain. 
Next important step in the investigation is to develop a relationship between snow fraction 
and depth. This would need field snow depth data. In North America this relationship was 
developed using 1400 field observatories. Relationship was found useful; if snow depth is 
less than 27 cm. Field data needs to be collected from Indian Meteorological Department. 
7.2 Introduction 
7.2.1 Overview and background 
The purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth 
product from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow 
pack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). 
However, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region 
of North America. The accuracy of snow depth retrievals was found 30% of observed snow 
depth for snow depth below 30 cm. The satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover is 
independent of snow depth, if snow depth is more than 30 cm (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). 
Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere 
winter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation 
balance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow

during wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can 
affect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher 
Himalayas. In order to make optimum utilization of snow information for hydrological, 
climatological and disaster purpose, snow depth is an important parameter. In addition, snow 
pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature 
can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et al. 2002a). 
Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important parameter for 
various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can 
also be used as an input for avalanche investigation. 
Snow was first observed by satellite in eastern Canada from the TIROS-1 satellite in April 
1960. Since then, the potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by 
the development of higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial 
resolution. In addition, satellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS 
and AWiFS have been used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al. 
2006). This is possibly due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible 
and short wave infrared region. Information generated from satellite observations has been 
extensively used for snowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing 
technique has been extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with 
the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis 
techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate 
areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow 
cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow 
and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of 
above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is 
needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time 
consuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is 
developed and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as 
compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow 
reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on 
satellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic can 
be effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover 
mapping (Hall et al. 1995). 
7.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover and Depth 
One of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. 
During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was 
carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was 
extensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the 
Himalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004). 
This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and 
availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA 
satellite. In this technique combination of visual and digital analysis technique was used. 
This was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February 
normally make it difficult to used only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the 
month of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from 
Snow depth

supervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow 
cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). 
Another important difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is 
further compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The 
discrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as 
textural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In 
Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, 
where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern and it can not be seen, when area is 
covered by cloud cover. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is 
very high. Therefore discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because 
of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, 
2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In 
these bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m 
has been successfully used to separate some types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 
2006). 
7.2.1.2 Estimation of Snow Reflectance in Himalaya 
In order to estimate snow fraction important step is estimation of reflectance. Reflectance of 
fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in 
the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and 
Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution 
becomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance 
snowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and 
other factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over 
time. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) 
up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow 
crystals metamorphose. 
One of the parameter, which can influence satellite obtained reflectance is terrain topography. 
The relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will 
determine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. The analysis 
carried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the 
amount of incident solar radiation for an increase of 10 in terrain slope (Srinivasulu and 
Kulkarni, 2003). 
Various parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral 
irradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-
sun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum 
and minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain 
slope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local 
illumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation 
incident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. 
Markham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for 
the Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating. To estimate reflectance from a 
rugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has 
to be used as given below: 
Snow depth

= L d2 / Esun cosi 
Where, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and i is the local illumination 
angle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by 
using the relation given by Robinson (1966). 
Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968; 
Dirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from 
snow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow 
can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular 
component characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow 
will change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by 
Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005). 
7.2.2 
Objective 
The purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth 
product from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow 
pack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). 
However, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region 
of North America. Therefore, this algorithm needs further development for application in 
mountainous Himalayan Terrain. This involves reflectance correction using local 
illumination angle, diffuse radiation from sidewalls and Bidirectional reflectance distribution 
Function (BRDF). BRDF is necessary as snow reflectance in anisotropic with aging.

7.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
7.4.1 Overview 
First step in this study is estimation of snow pixels. A grouped-criteria technique 
incorporating a NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm will be used due to the 
following reasons: 
1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat. Its accuracy has 
been tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared 
from other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps 
using MODIS data. 
2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar 
illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as 
Himalayas. 
3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial 
resolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel 
number 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be 
generated at 1 km resolution. 
4) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, 
computationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the 
product is generated. 
Snow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The 
Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from 
Snow depth

many other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A 
similar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been 
proven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year 
(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished 
using the NDSI. 
Other promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, 
spectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable 
for automatic application at the global scale. They are also computationally intensive. 
Training or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application of 
techniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional 
applications and possibly even global application in future years. 
7.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
7.4.1.1.1 Identification of Snow pixels 
The snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A 
regional, daily snow product will be produced. An 10-day composited snow cover product 
will be generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield 
maximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit 
during that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free 
on all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics 
will also be included to assist analysis of the data product. 
There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow 
maps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the 
NOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer 
composition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this 
period optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. The repeat period of the 
satellite is 16 days. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; 
therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite 
product for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done 
using the daily data. 
7.4.1.1.2 Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) 
The NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus 
clouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance 
difference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is 
insensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions, is partially normalized for atmospheric 
effects, and does not depend on reflectance in a single band (Kulkarni 2006). The NDSI is 
analogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; 
Townshend and Tucker, 1984). 
 NDSI = (INSAT Band 1 - INSAT Band 2) / (INSAT Band 1 + INSAT Band 2) 
Pixels that are approximately 25 % or greater covered by snow have been found to have 
NDSI values 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et. 
al., 2006). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to 
separate water from snow. 
Snow depth 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

121
These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, 
comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et. al. 
2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. 
Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be 
distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006). 
In forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly 
classify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (negi et. al., 
2006; Hall et al, 1998). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the NDSI 
are used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. 
Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using 
the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested 
areas without compromising the algorithm performance in other land covers. Since 
appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be generated using 
AWiFS sensor. 
The NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values 
observed in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested 
pixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, 
yet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., 
1998). 
7.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination 
Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow 
reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by 
their generally-high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic 
spectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave 
infrared part of the spectrum. 
While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify 
or discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data 
show that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. This algorithm 
will be further improves, as INSAT 3D Met payload is having thermal bands. Appropriate 
brigtness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al., 
2003). This will be additional criteria than in build criteria of NDSI. 
7.4.1.1.4 Estimation of Snow Reflectance 
Various parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral 
irradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-
sun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum 
and minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain 
slope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local 
illumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation 
incident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. 
Markham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for 
the Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating. To estimate reflectance from a 
rugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has 
to be used as given below: 
Snow depth

= L d2 / Esun cosi 
Where, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and i is the local illumination 
angle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by 
using the relation given by Robinson (1966). 
Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968; 
Dirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from 
snow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow 
can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular 
component characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow 
will change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by 
Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005). 
F(i, i, r, r) = dLr (i, i, r, r)/Li cos i dwi 
Where, 
i = Zenith angle of incident ray 
i = Azimuth angle of incident ray 
r = Zenith angle of reflected ray 
r = Azimuth angle of reflected ray 
Li = Incident radiance 
dLr = Reflected radiance in solid angle 
dwi = Solid angle 
7.4.1.1.5 SNOW FRACTION RETRIEVAL 
To calculate snow fraction (F), technique similar to a linear mixture technique can be used 
(Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). This techniques need two end members representing the 
visible reflectance of a completely snow-covered and completely snow-free land surface, 
Rsnow and Rland, respectively. 
F = (R-Rland) / (Rsnow-Rland) 
Where, R is the observed visible reflectance of the scene. The reflectance of snow free land 
in every grid cell of the map will be established from satellite data obtained during snow free 
season. The reflectance of snow assumed to be independent of location and determined 
empirically from satellite data or from field reflectance observations. Previous investigations 
have shown that snow fraction retrievals was unreliable over mountainous area due to 
frequent specular reflectance effects on satellite observed visible reflectance (Romanov and 
Tarpley, 2004). Attempt will be made to resolve this problem by using concepts mentioned 
above as local illumination angle correction, Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function 
and multiple data analysis in a day. 
7.4.1.1.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOW FRACTION AND DEPTH 
Romanov and Tarpley, (2004) have developed a statistical relationship between satellite 
observed snow fraction and field observed snow depth. For this purpose field snow depth 
data of 1400 locations in Great Plains of USA and Canadian Prairies were analyzed. During 
matching observations, to reduce the effect of possible inhomogeneity of the snow depth 
distribution and inaccuracy of gecoding, snow fraction was averaged 3 x 3 grid. For 
development of this technique, forested region was exclude. A statistical relationship was 
developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). 
D = eaF 1 
Snow depth 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

123
Where, D (cm) is the snow depth, F (%) is the snow fraction and a is a parameter. The best 
approximation of snow fraction and snow depth was achieve with a = 0.0333. This means 
100 percent snow fraction can give snow depth around 27 cm. This could be major limitation 
in the Himalaya, as snow depth is normally very high due orographic effect and avalanche 
accumulation of snow. 
In order to apply this concept in the Himalaya, daily snow depth data needs to be collected 
from IMD and SASE observatories and region specific relationship needs to be developed. 
This relationship should be developed using historical INSAT, MODIS and snow depth data.

Operational Implementation 

7.4.2.1 
Step 1: Conversion from gray count to BT 
In this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness 
temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D data. The radiometrically-
processed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and 
geometrically corrected product for further analysis. 

7.4.2.2 
Step 2: Cloud elimination 
This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D image. Cloud screening is based 
on the temperature data and will help to clear cloudy pixels, which possibly are not feasible 
to screen out using visible and SWIR channel based NDSI image. 

7.4.2.3 
Step 3: Topographic and Atmospheric correction 
In this step, DEM data will be used to compute the terrain parameters like slope and aspect of 
the terrain, which will further be used to compute the local illumination angle. Atmospheric 
correction algorithm will be applied to compute the atmospherically corrected radiance and 
reflectance values with standard procedures. This step will provide us the atmospherically 
and topographically corrected radiances and reflectance. 

7.4.2.4 
Step 4: Snow pixel identification 
Snow pixel identification will be done by using NDSI based approach which uses the 
normalized ratio of visible and SWIR wavelength reflectance. This prepares a binary map of 
either snow or non-snow pixels. 

7.4.2.5 
Snow fraction retrieval 
Fractional snow map will be prepared by using linear mixing approach. This considers land 
and pure snow as end members and compute the snow fraction of any particular pixel using 
reflectance value. 

7.4.2.6 
Snow Depth Estimation 
A statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and 
Tarpley, 2004). Snow depth will be estimated by using this relationship for each pixel.

7.6 Validation 

7.6.1 Comparison of INSAT 3D snow depth with field observations: 
INSAT-derived snow depth will continue to be compared with snow depth obtained from 
field locations. Sites, which were used for development of snow depth algorithm, will be 
used during validation, however both the activites will be carried out at different time frame. 

7.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow Depth Mapping 
Standard statistical methods will be used to assess error of estimation, as snow depth data is 
available from field and satellite. 

7.7 Technical issues: 
The snow depth of this method is limited to 27 cm of snow depth in prairie region which is 
expected to deteriorate further for highly rugged Himalayan mountain. It is required to 
develop the exponential relationship for Himalayan region based on snow depth. 

7.8 Future Scope 
In future scope the developed statistical relationship of snow depth with fractional snow will 
be modified for Himalayan region as and when data will be available. Indian Meteorological 
Department will provide field data of snow depth and snow fraction.

Introduction 
In this document, we offer some background to the fire identification problem, list 
the INSAT-3D instrument characteristics, describe the theoretical basis of the fire 
identification algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical 
aspects of the algorithm implementation, and outline the planned validation approach, the 
technical issues and the future scope. 

8.2.1 Overview and background 
Forest fire management in tropical countries is one of the major issues. Forest fire quite 
frequently occurs during summer seasons in tropical countries. A study by forest survey 
of India has revealed that 51% of the forest area in Assam and Gujarat, 93% in Arunachal 
Pradesh, 67% in Bihar, 69% in Himanchal Pradesh, 46 % in Jammu and Kashmir, 45% in 
Karnataka, 76% in Madhya Pradesh, 94% in Meghalaya and Orissa, 87% in Nagaland, 
58% in Uttar Pradesh and 33% in W. Bengal is subject to annual fires. 
One of the most important critical elements of the forest fire management system (FFMS) 
in the country is the real time detection onset of fire and its monitoring; study the rate, 
direction and quantitative estimation of fire spread and amount of smoke emission. 
Satellite data with suitable spectral bands for fire detection (Visible, SWIR, MIR and 
Thermal IR bands), daily or twice a days repetivity (day and night) and bare minimum 
spatial resolution, which can locate the fire, can play an important role in development of 
countrys FFMS. Geostationary satellite such as GOES with automated biomass burning 
algorithm (ABBA) have matured enough for providing information on large-scale forest 
fires on a regular basis (Prins et al, 1992, 1994, 1998). INSAT-3D imager data with 1 km 
resolution in Visible and SWIR bands and 4 km. in MIR and in TIR-I and TIR-II will 
help in detecting and monitoring of large scale forest fires, smoke and burn scar. 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving forest fire areas 
from INSAT-3D multi-wavelength thermal radiation measurements in clear skies. 
The INSAT-3D fire products will be built on the experience of fire assessment using the 
MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR and GOES systems. The fire products will include an 
identification of the occurrence of thermal anomalies, and an estimate the total emitted

energy from the fire. The products will be made available at full resolution (4 km) and as 
spatial summaries and temporal composites. Daytime and nighttime fire distributions 
products will be identified. 
The fire products will be developed on the basis of convergence of evidence from 
different spectral information. The INSAT-3D fire products will provide information on 
the location of a fire, its emitted energy, and an estimate of area burned. The fire products 
will be made available through IMD as daily 4 km resolution and spatially and 
temporally summarized products (10 km, and 8 day and monthly), more suited for use by 
the broader environmental management community as well as modelling community. 
8.2.2 Objective 
The basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying fire using 
INSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time 
application of INSAT 3D data in the identification of fire. 
8.3 
Inputs 
Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced radiant temperature (in deg 
Kelvin) for MIR,TIR-I,TIR-II, along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith 
angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). Additionally there is a requirement for 
temperature data from all IMD-stations, which will help in defining thresholds. Cloud 
and land/sea mask data will also be used. All these inputs are specifically categorised in 
the following subsections: 
8.3.1 Static Data 
About 10 years temperature data from all IMD-stations (as stated in table below), 
interpolated to geo-referenced raster format (GeoTIFF) at 4x4 km spatial resolution for 
entire India. This will be useful in defining the background temperature for different 
temperature zones.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 
The INSAT-3D fire detection and characterization techniques are planned to be fully 
automated for the production of daily fire information at country level. In order to detect 
the presence of fire in a non-interactive fashion, a set of detection multiband thresholding 
criteria different for the day and night fire observations are prescribed. These criteria are 
based on the apparent temperature of the fire pixel and the difference between the fire 
pixel and its background temperature. In this section we describe the theoretical basis and 
algorithm overview for identification of fire. 

8.4.1 Overview 
8.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
 Any object above absolute zero ( 0 K; -273.16o C; -459.69o F) emits EMR. 
 As temp. increases the maxima shifts towards shorter wave length.

 max=2897/T ; m (Wiens displacement law) can give max. W.L. at 
which the exitance is maximum & is related to Temp. (e,g, max=9.66 at 
300o K) 

INSAT MIR Channel (3.70 to 3.95m) is located near the spectral maximum for 
radiative emission for objects radiating at temperature around 400 to 1200 K. this 
temperature is closed to the temperature of burning forest biomass. INSAT, TIR-I 
Channel (10.20m 11.30m) and TIR-II (11.5m to 12.5m) are located near the 
spectral maxima for normal environment temperature i.e. around 300 K (fig.1). 
Therefore, both these channels will be useful in fire detection algorithms.

Fire detection algorithms using daily NOAA AVHRR images developed by Li. et al., 
(2000) and latest version of Fire Identification, Mapping and Monitoring algorithms 
(FIMMA) developed by NOAA/NESDIS will be evaluated. Pixel will be flagged as 
containing fire if the values of its brightness temperature and or reflectance exceeds or 
falls below certain predetermined threshold values, which are fixed during development

phase. Visible and SWIR bands will be utilized for masking clouds and water bodies. 
Contextual Algorithm (Giglio, et al., 1999: and Kaufman, et al., 1998) is proposed at this 
stage. 
A fire location represents the approximate location of the fire pixels and do not represent 
the actual fire size, which is usually much smaller than pixel size (4 km.). The INSAT at 
Nadir is 4x4 Km, for MIR and TIR, which is quite large, but the fire phenomenon is 
usually much smaller than that. Studies at Cooperative Institute of Meteorological 
Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin have shown that the sub 
satellite point, and smoldering at 450 K, in case of GOES (IFOV: 4x4Km) is 
approximately 0.5 to 1 acre in size in relatively non-cloudy conditions. 
Robinson (1991) has shown that due to very high amplification over background at 3.7 
m for forest fires occupying even a small fraction of a percent of an AVHRR pixel can 
substantially increase the mid IR brightness of the entire pixel. Therefore, fire (active 
fire) can be monitored at very low spatial resolution. 
8.4.1.2 Algorithm Overview 
The fire detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding contextual 
technique, which includes multi band thresholds, and compares with the background. The 
algorithm will first masks out ocean, desert, water and cloud pixels and then proceed 
further. The contextual algorithms identify a fire pixel based on the level of contrast 
between the potential fire pixel and its background pixels (the definition of background 
varies according to kernel size). As opposed to the fixed threshold techniques, which 
must be defined for given regions and seasons, the contextual algorithm is supposed to be 
flexible and effective in different environmental conditions. Potential fire pixels will be 
identified using a less restrictive version of the threshold algorithm. These threshold 
values will be determined through visual inspection of known fire/non-fire pixels. An 
initial threshold reduces the number of candidate pixels to be applied to the contextual 
algorithm. The contextual algorithm is based on detecting the contrast between a pixel 
and its background. A pixels background can be defined as the 15x15 window 
surrounding the subject pixel. Because of the large areal extent of many interior Indian 
wildfires, it is necessary to have such a large window size to define the background 
values. If a background window size is too small (for example, 3x3), there is a good 
chance that large wildfires occupying several pixels will elevate the background values 
rendering the fire undetectable. 
The algorithm is a three-step process: 
First, the temperatures of channels 3, 5, & 6 of INSAT-3D from pixels adjacent to the 
test pixel will be averaged; these values will be utilized in a separate algorithm to 
estimate background temperature and adjusted temperature values for channels 3 & 5. 
Second, a user-defined minimum fire temperature of interest will be specified. 

Third, if the adjusted temperature value for channel 3 is greater than the threshold 
channel 3 temperature, the pixel is classified as fire. The fire identification algorithm 
flowchart is given in next subsection:

analyzing the ground data for different regions and seasons) 

8.4.2 
Operational retrieval Implementation 
The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: 
Step 1 : Conversion of gray counts to radiance and radiant temperatures 

Step 2 : Cloud, Land/Sea, desert and major inland water bodies masking 

Step 3: Solar logic flag: pixel is sunlit if the solar zenith angle is >0o and <86.5o to 
partition day and night pixels and have dynamic thresholds for MIR channel 
(3.9m). [ e.g. T3 = (300+15*cos (solar zenith angle)] K]. 

Step 4: Defining of thresholds for background temperature using historical IMD 
data and building thresholds for different parts of the country and for different 
seasons. Training dataset of actual forest fires over the Indian region for MIR, TIR-I 
and TIR-II channels. The methodology to be followed is to first assume initial 
value of thresholds and then fine tune them, using visual inspection.

Introduction 
In this document, we offer some background to the smoke identification problem, list the 
INSAT-3D instrument characteristics, describe the theoretical basis of the smoke 
identification algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects 
of the algorithm implementation, and outline the planned validation approach, the technical 
issues and the future scope. 

9.2.1 Overview and Background 
Smoke is a form of particulate matter, which contains liquid or solid particles of the size 
ranging from 1200m. It is formed by combustion or other chemical processes. Each year 
more than 100 million tons of smoke aerosols are released into the atmosphere as a result of 
biomass burning. More than 80percent of this burning is in the tropical regions [1]. Smoke 
plumes can travel over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers horizontally and also reach 
up to stratosphere under certain atmospheric circulation conditions. Thus smoke can have an 
impact far beyond the region of fire activity. Smoke play a major role on the radiation 
balance of the earth-atmosphere system. Smoke particles scatter and absorb incoming solar 
radiation, thereby having a two-fold impact, i.e. a cooling effect at the surface, but warming 
effect on the atmosphere. Since the magnitude of the scattering effect outweighs that of 
absorption, smoke has a net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere-surface system. This 
is often called the direct effect of smoke aerosols [1]. 
Smoke can also modify the short wave reflective properties of clouds by acting as cloud 
condensation nuclei [2]. Under a limited supply of water vapor, an increased number of 
nuclei result in smaller cloud droplets that have higher reflectivity than larger cloud 
droplets .This effect called the indirect radiative forcing, is difficult to quantify and has large 
uncertainties associated with the sign and magnitudes. 
Understanding such numerous and complex effects of smoke on weather and climate requires 
a good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of smoke and its optical properties, 
which is only feasible by means of satellite observation. Identification of smoke on satellite

imagery is a prerequisite to study and retrieve physical, chemical, and optical properties of 
smoke. 

9.2.2 Objective 
The basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying smoke using 
INSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time application 
of INSAT 3D data in the identification of smoke. 
9.3 
Inputs 
Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for 
Visible channel and geo-referenced Brightness temperature for MIR,TIR1, TIR2, along with 
satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). 
Additionally there is a requirement for dataset of forest fires acquired over India for defining 
thresholds. 
All these inputs are specifically categorized in the following subsections.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 
Automatic detection of smoke pixels in a satellite imagery calls for development of algorithm 
employing multi-thresholding techniques and utilizing multi-band satellite data. In this 
section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of smoke. 
9.4.1 Overview 

9.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
Identification of smoke through satellite observations is a challenge in itself. The large 
spectral overlap in the spectral signature smoke and other scene types such as clouds and 
background surfaces has complicated the problem. Till date, very few studies have been done 
to discriminate smoke in a satellite imagery. The most commonly used method of identifying 
smoke is to assign different colors to different channels or channel combinations. The 
resulting false-color images can provide visual separation of smoke from other objects. For 
example, Kaufman et al. [2] assigned AVHRR channel 1 to red, channel 2 to green, and 
inverse channel 4 to blue, generating a composite image showing smoke plumes [3]. The 
Hazard Mapping System (HMS) developed in 2001 by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite and Data 
Information Service (NESDIS) also generated the smoke outlines manually, primarily 
utilizing animated visible band satellite imagery. 
Smoke plumes and their path can also be traced using temporal satellite imagery, through 
image processing techniques. But this methodology is a manual detection technique and can 
hardly be used for automatic detection of smoke in satellite imageries. Some sporadic efforts 
in the direction of distinguishing smoke in satellite imagery has been made in the past. The 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-8 employed the automated smoke/ 
aerosol detection algorithm (ASADA) to monitor biomass burning in South America [4], 
while some attempts for automatic detection of smoke using artificial neural networks and 
threshold approaches applied to AVHRR imagery was made by Li et al [3] 
In general, smoke is composed of many small particles suspended in the air. These particles 
scatter and absorb (attenuate) different spectra of electromagnetic radiation. This absorption 
reduces transmittance of that radiation through the smoke. The effect of smoke aerosol as 
function of wavelength forms the crux of its satellite detection algorithm. Smoke has a large 
effect in the visible part of the spectrum, decreasing in magnitude with wavelength from the 
blue to the red region. In the near IR the effect is smaller than the variation in the surface 
reflectance between the smoke free area and the area affected by smoke. The smoke effect is 
not observable in the mid IR (2.2 m) region due to the large ratio of the wavelength of 
radiation to the size of particles. 
Thus using visible channel it is possible to distinguish smoke plumes over land. But the 
diffusion processes associated with smoke and clouds lead to fuzzy boundaries between them. 
Hence although the reflectance of smoke is generally less than that of clouds, the latter has so 
large a range of variation that it is difficult to use it to discriminate smoke pixels from cloudy 
pixels. Thus the biggest challenge in smoke detection is to isolate smoke from a smoke/ 
Haze/ Cloud mix in a satellite imagery. Discrimination between smoke and clouds is 
generally made on the basis of cloud classification.

The channels Visible, MIR, TIR-1, TIR-2 of the INSAT-3D imager exhibit some distinction 
in the characteristics of smoke, clouds and underlying surface which is the basis of smoke 
identification. 

Algorithm Overview 
The smoke detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding technique, which 
includes single and multi band difference thresholds, corrected albedo calculations, sun glint 
mask and cloud edge detection. It first eliminates Smoke/ Cloud/ Haze free pixels and then 
screens out different kinds of cloudy pixels to arrive at smoke pixels. In general, the 
reflectance and brightness temperature of dense smoke have intermediate values between 
those of clouds and land. The reflectance of smoke is usually less than that of clouds, but 
higher than that of the underlying surface, while the converse is true for brightness 
temperature So double sided thresholding is applied in form of these five pass tests. 

First pass Test: 
A first pass thresholding is done on the visible channel counts to limit values indicative of 
haze/cloud mix. 

Second pass Test: 
Second pass is albedo thresholding to further screen out cloud/ surface reflectance over 
land and water. 
Albedo Calculation for the VIS channel 

 where A is the albedo, Lr is the radiance, 
is the solar zenith angle and F0 is the incident 
radiance if the satellite were to look directly at the sun, which is computed as: 

where S is the spectral irradiance of the sun and w is the spectral response function for the 
channel. 

Third pass Test: 
Since sun glint often produces the same signature as smoke in visible imagery, regions with 
reflected solar angles less than a threshold value are not processed to avoid those areas 
affected by sun glint. 

Fourth pass Test: 
Thresholding on brightness temperature of MIR, TIR-1 and difference of these two channels 
is implemented to screen out opaque cirrus and stratus clouds. Since clouds usually have cold 
tops, they have low brightness temperatures in TIR-1 channel. Further the large difference in 
the brightness temperatures between the MIR and the TIR-1 channels due to the reflection of 
solar energy at 3.9m is succesful in screening out water clouds. 

Smoke 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

146
Fifth pass Test: 
Thresholds are placed on the brightness temperature of TIR-1, TIR-2 and difference of these 
two channels is implemented to screen out low level moisture and cirrus clouds. 
Thresholding based on differences between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and TIR-2 are 
widely used for cloud screening and is often referred to as the split window technique. 

Pseudo Channel Index (PCI) Test : 
Even after applying the above tests , misclassification between smoke and clouds is possible. 
For further screening, pseudo channel (CLD) is made use of and defined as: 
Visible)
(
(TIR2)
Visible)
(
(TIR2)
CLD

(3) 
where TIR2 and Visible refer to the radiation received in 12 m and 0.65 m channels 
respectively [5]. 
Owing to their different signatures in the pseudo channel, smoke plumes and clouds can be 
discriminated using a CLD threshold. Although in earlier studies CLD and Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) feature space analysis was used for categorization of 
smoke and cloud, it was found to generate false alarms and was eventually improved by 
using multi-temporal change detection technique. However, in this study, it has been found 
that combining CLD with conventional multi-threshold test also improves the robustness of 
smoke detection. Thus pixels are further required to pass the following test,

CLD C

(4) 
where C1 is the threshold value for smoke plumes. 

If a pixel passes all these 5 tests, surrounding pixels are checked to screen out cloud edge 
pixels.A flow diagram is given to illustrate the flow of the smoke detection algorithm.

9.4.2 Operational retrieval implementation 
The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: 
1. Conversion of gray counts to radiance and brightness temperatures 

2. Conversion of gray counts to Albedo for the VIS channel 
This is done with the help of conversion tables. 

3. Calculation of solar reflectance angle 
To exclude sun glint processing path is taken for solar reflectance angle r greater 
than 
threshold value (approximately 20deg)[4], where 

where is the viewing zenith angle, is the azimuth angle and, 0 is the Solar Zenith 
Angle. 

4. Defining of thresholds 
Using training dataset of forest fires over the Indian region for VIS, MIR , TIR-1 and 
TIR-2 channels, thresholds have to be defined for tests listed above. The methodology

to be followed is to first assume initial value of thresholds based on literature and 
then fine tune them, using visual inspection.

10.2 Introduction 
10.2.1 Overview and background 
Aerosols play an important role in numerous aspects of human life. Aerosols have large-
scale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman 
and Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with 
clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is also 
critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and 
military operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to 
CO2 greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, 
1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element. 
When in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility, 
and public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol 
distribution at global and regional scales. 
This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the algorithm used to 
retrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) for the INSAT-3D Imager instrument 
operating from a geostationary platform. The output product description is summarized in 
Table 1. 
Specifically, this document identifies the sources of input data, both INSAT-3D imager 
and non- INSAT-3D imager data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and 
mathematical background underlying the use of this information in the retrievals; 
includes implementation details; and describes assumptions and limitations of the 
proposed approach.

10.2.2 Objective 
The objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional 
to the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian 
region on twice daily basis. As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical 
thickness cannot be found for cloudy pixels. Retrievals are only performed during the 
daytime due to the lack of light in the visible channel of INSAT-3D imager data during 
the nighttime. The overall objectives of the aerosol retrieval is: 
To determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 650 nm and 4 Km spatial resolution over 
both land and ocean surfaces with root mean square (RMS) error of 0.1. Optical 
thickness () is related to transmission (t) by t=exp(-). Optical thickness retrievals apply 
only under clear and daytime conditions.

10.4.1 Overview 
It has been demonstrated that aerosol optical thickness can be retrieved from solar-
reflected radiance, and that aerosol size distribution information is carried in the spectral 
dependence of aerosol optical thickness. Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited 
to one (GOES) or two channels (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) 
were used first to derive the total aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model. 
The relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the 
look up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed 
Aerosols 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

156
reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information 
on the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the 
corrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical 
thickness. 
The approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required 
for aerosol optical depth retrieval. A near-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated 
pixels, then the surface reflectance in the visible bands is calculated from the observed 
reflectance in the near-IR band. The optical thickness is initially calculated assuming a 
continental aerosol model. The suspended matter information is used to choose a better 
aerosol model and more accurate values of optical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997). 
In spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to 
once or twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar 
satellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such 
sparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show 
little systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show 
significant diurnal patterns. It is required to understand aerosol plume movement to track 
and forecast plume movement in the interest of human health. Therefore, it is important 
to monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol. 
The INSAT-3D imager data from geostationary platform has the potential to provide 
aerosol observations over land and ocean with multiple observations per day. Many 
studies have demonstrated the potential of Geostationary Operational Environmental 
Satellite (GOES) series of imager sensors to provide quantitative estimates of aerosol 
optical depth. Their sensitivity studies, however, concluded that retrievals depend on 
aerosol optical property assumptions and surface reflectance. Studies using geostationary 
satellites (e.g. GOES-8) and larger validation networks (e.g. Aerosol Robotic Network
AERONET) supported those initial findings. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2001) and Knapp 
et al. (2002) showed that aerosol monitoring from GOES is possible for South America. 
However, this region has optimal retrieval conditions: surface cover with little variability 
(i.e. rainforest) and large aerosol optical depths (from biomass burning). 
Recent study by Knapp et al. (2005) has shown operational potential of GOES series of 
sensors for the monitoring of aerosol optical depth over land. A method is proposed by 
Knapp et al (2005) to correct surface effects and retrieve aerosol optical depth using 
visible reflectance measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental 
Satellite (GOES). The surface contribution is determined from temporal compositing of 
visible imagery, where darker pixels correspond to less atmospheric attenuation and 
surface reflectance is deduced from the composite using radiative transfer. The method is 
applied to GOES-8 imagery over the eastern US. Retrieved surface reflectance is 
compared with separate retrievals using a priori ground based observations of aerosol 
optical depth. 
10.4.1.1 
Theoretical Background 
The INSAT-3D imager data will be used to perform the surface reflectance and aerosol 
optical depth () retrievals and mask for clouds. It measures top of the atmosphere (TOA) 
radiance in six channels: three at infrared wavelengths, one in the visible wavelength and 
one sensitive to both solar and Earth-emitted radiance. Primarily, the visible channel 
Aerosols 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

157
(0.520.72 mm full width at half maximum) is sensitive to aerosol scattering, so the 
remaining channels are used for cloud masking. The cloud mask algorithm is based on 
the Clouds from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (CLAVR) 
algorithm (Stowe et al. 1999) which uses spectral and spatial thresholds to test for the 
presence of clouds. 
The retrieval of aerosol information from INSAT-3D imager data is a two-step process: 
1) Cloud masking 
2) Composite the visible images to estimate the surface reflectance, and 
3) Use the surface reflectance with an image to retrieve the aerosol optical depth. 
 Cloud Masking 
Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the 
underlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold 
approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. Following threshold based tests 
will be performed to detect the cloudy pixles. 
a) Visible and Mid-wave Infrared Window Reflectance Threshold Test 
The reflectance threshold test using visible band of INSTA-3D along with 3.9 micron 
channel where values > 6% are considered to be cloudy, will be used. 
b) IR Window Temperature Threshold and Difference Tests 
Simple thresholds based cloud screening test will be established over land and ocenic 
features using the TIR data of the INSAT-3D. 
 Surface Reflectance Retrieval 
Estimating the surface contribution to the TOA INSAT-3D Imager visible reflectance is 
difficult since observations will have atmospheric contamination. For instance, a visible 
observation from INSAT-3D Imager on a cloudless day with low aerosol burden will still 
have: gaseous absorption (primarily, ozone and water vapour); Rayleigh scattering; and 
residual aerosol extinction. This atmospheric component to the TOA reflectance needs to 
be removed to retrieve the surface reflectance. While studies have shown it is possible to 
estimate the surface component from observations in the near-infrared (e.g. 2.1 m) 
where aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low, the INSAT-3D imager lacks an 
observation at this wavelength. Therefore, a compositing method will be used to estimate 
the surface reflectance. 
The visible imagery is composited to determine the surface contribution to the top-of-the- 
atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. For each pixel in the visible image, the darkest 
observation over the course of some time period is called the composite clear reflectance. 
By using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes: that aerosol would 
increase the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the time period is 
somewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time period is needed for at least one 
cloud-free observation. Knapp et. al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. A 
radiative transfer model, the second simulation of satellite signal in the in the solar 
spectrum (6S) will be used to convert the TOA observed reflectance to a surface 
reflectance. This atmospheric correction removes Rayleigh scattering and gaseous 
Aerosols 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

158
absorption, leaving the Lambertian surface reflectance. This is then used in following 
calculations to retrieve aerosol optical depth in the subsequent aerosol optical depth 
retrieval. 
Cloud shadows, however, can contaminate the composite reflectance. At high solar zenith 
angles (i.e. during early morning and late afternoon), high clouds may cast large 
shadows. In the shadow regions, the direct downward solar radiance is obscured at the 
surface, thereby reducing the surface reflectance. The second darkest observation will 
be used in the composite clear reflectance (CCR) method to reduce the effect of cloud 
shadows. By selecting the second darkest pixel, a cloud shadow would need to be present 
on at least two days during the period to affect the composite. 
The accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For 
instance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the 
surface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be 
likely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric 
component remains large in such situations. 
Atmospheric effectsaerosol extinction, Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption 
will be removed from the composite using the second simulation of the satellite signal in 
the solar spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. This will retrieve the surface reflectance, 
sfc. 
Some aerosols are still present in the composite reflectance; their radiative effect must be 
removed as well. This aerosol will be simulated using rural and dust aerosol model, given 
its ability to simulate the aerosol signal over the Indian region. This will represent the 
aerosol extinction still present in a composite reflectance. The amount of background 
aerosol is difficult to determine because it varies with season, length of CCR and time of 
day. However, it has been reported that background aerosol can vary from 0.02 to 0.08. 
 Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval 
The aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using a INSAT-3D imager visible image 
and the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the optical 
depth of the rural and dust model in the 6S radiative transfer model is increased until the 
theoretical reflectance matches that in the INSAT-3D imager observation. 
The second simulation (6S) model will be used to simulate sat observations. Satellite 
altitude INSAT-3D imager visible band (0.55-0.75 m) radiances will be simulated as a 
function of geometric angles determining the satellite viewing geometry and time of the 
day, surface reflectance R, and aerosol optical depth ( varying from 0 to 3) at 650 nm. 
The aerosol optical depth will be retrieved using a look up table (LUT). The retrieval 
method then will depend on the interpolation within the LUT, finding the t which 
corresponds to the observed sat . The uncertainties in such a retrieval is dependent upon 
the accuracy of the model parameters

10.6.2 Methods of validation 
 AERONET data for Validation 
Post-launch routine ground-based observations can be made using AERONET, and any 
of the several miscellaneous techniques, including the diffuse/direct method, aureole 
meters, and polarization measurements. AeRoNet (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a 
network of ground-based sun-photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben 
of Code 923 of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS. 
The sun-photometers measure the spectral aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In 
India 3 Aeronet sites namely Kanpur, Goa and Dharwar are providing systematic in-situ 
AOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of INSAT-3D 
derived AODs. 
 Post-Launch Special Field Experiments 
Many of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to 
provide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. The INSAT-3D Imager 
derived aerosol optical thickness measurements will be validated using hand-held sun-

photometer. The details of these campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will 
be decided later on. 
 Post-Launch Satellite-Based Inter-comparisons 
INSAT-3D Imager derived aerosol optical depths may be validated by comparing them 
with aerosol optical depths derived by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS. The basic 
inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where both 
sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter-
comparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements. 
10.7 
Technical issues (Limitation etc.) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the 
satellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept 
in mind. 
i) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study. Use of darkest 
observation for last 20 days provides mean reflectivity. 
10.8 
Future Scope 
i) 
In future algorithms making use of INSAT-3D imager data for SWIR and MIR 
bands can also be attempted for characterization of surface reflectivity.

Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud Motion 
Vectors (CMVs) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation 
procedure. The INSAT-3D will have two IR window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5-
12.5 m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived 
CMV and INSAT-3D IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the 
vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the 
planned validation approach. 

 11.2.1 Overview and background 
 Spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical 
weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed 
time interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the 
cloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector (CMV) 
studies and spatiotemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatiotemporal life cycle 
includes the generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a 
sequence of geostationary satellite images. During the 1970s and early 1980s, cloud motion 
winds were produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental 
Satellite Data and Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual 
techniques. Early automated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors but often yielded 
in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment was automatic but 
often contained errors for semitransparent cirrus clouds. In the subsequent years, due to the 
developments in image-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it

was possible to design fully automatic techniques for CMV retrieval, and NESDIS began its 
application in 1992. In later time, several new developments were made to make accurate 
retrievals of cloud motion winds. For example, CO2 slicing algorithm was replaced by H2O 
intercept algorithm for assigning the height to semitransparent tracers. Other improvements 
were (i) automated correction of navigation inconsistencies within the imageries (ii) 
inclusion of spatial filters in tracer selection methodology to filter undesirable scenes. 

11.2.2 Objective 
The main objective of this study is to derive the Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) over land 
and sea using multiple half hourly IR images. The region over which the winds are derived 
should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.

11.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
11.4.1 Overview 
11.4.1.1 Methodology 
 11.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection 
At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial 
cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target 
domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any 
gradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also 
undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted 
targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in 
a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify 
the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold 
value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-
directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the 
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-
generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 
1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area 
of 32 X 32 IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial 
coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-
level cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the infrared channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is 
coarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a 
template) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we 
used 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly 
in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image 
anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

 represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents 
the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally 
produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This 
difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). As per the location of 
the tracer, the template window is re-located with tracer position at the centre. A schematic 
diagram is shown in Fig. 2 
11.4.1.1.2 Height assignment 
The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are 
derived using the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) 
technique or the water vapor histogram method (HIST), the H2O intercept method (Nieman et 
al., 1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few 
gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: 
2.1 Infrared Window Channel (WIN) and Water Vapor Histogram Methods 
(HIST): 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing 
either infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model

168
forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud 
temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess 
field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of 
temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of 
opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level 
(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. 
Semitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual 
movement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in 
these cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud 
emissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are 
warmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high 
in pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at 
the estimated cloud height. 
2.2 Water VaporInfrared Window Intercept Method (H2O): 
Height assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two 
different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of 
view at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and 
opaque cloud radiances.

 is the opaque ("black") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the 
fractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric 
pressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with 
cloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck 
radiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation 
represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at 
a pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current 
atmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model 
forecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an 
observed atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height 
can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances 
at each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different 
heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the 
center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface 
and cloud conditions.

Fig 1: Measured radiances (mW m2 sr1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman 
et al., 1993) 

By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount 
is one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. 
The cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric 
Gaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. 
These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances 
can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to 
calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the 
calculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances 
obtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed 
radiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is 
due to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of 
water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between 
the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure 
value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. 
2.3 Cloud Base Method (BASE): 
Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or 
altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the 
cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A 
method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to 
estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a 
histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being 
examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the 
histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. 
Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid 
cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy 
distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of 
the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same 
distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud 
base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target 
Cloud motion vector

170
location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those 
targets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude 
lower than 600 hPa). This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous 
Infrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these 
winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa 
(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). 
Once the infrared tracers heights using the above three algorithms and water vapor tracers 
heights using the HIST and H2O methods have been calculated, the best height among the 
available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the 
calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific 
infrared tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE 
height is used as the final height. 
11.4.1.1.3 Tracking 
If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected 
tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a 
bigger search window, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize 
the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also 
considered. The search area is optimized within 30 degree from the model wind direction at 
that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the 
search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the 
template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used 
operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. 
However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are 
calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). 
It is defined as

(4) 
Where 
tI and 
sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window 
and 
tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of 
template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of 
the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is 
normalized to values between and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, 
E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 
implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model 
efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of 
E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe 
model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards 
the higher end (e.g. as E 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation 
coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two 
objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main 
advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, 
because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features 
Cloud motion vector

171
compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of 
mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that 
of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking 
method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean 
region (Deb et al., 2008).

11.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control 
Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the 
coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the 
AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the 
retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at 
EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS 
(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of 
wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. 
In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of 
images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 3). The 
previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation 
timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a 
coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of 
coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality 
flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its 
surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex 
number

. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-
pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 
neighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness 
characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial 
neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. 
The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences
dif

, excluding the 
difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector 
differences 

dif
V
 is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the 
average of 10 
dif
V
 is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is 
determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which 
is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average 
of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from 
final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, 
search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it 
goes to next previous times steps and so on.

In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets 
(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they dont get support. 
Cloud motion vector

Hundreds of isolated vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real 
situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the 
past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level 
and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, 
if we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 
UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and 
represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is 
used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the 
second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds 
retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 
04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine 
images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and 
process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of 
valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 

11.4.2 Operational Implementation 

11.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT 
 In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured 
radiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the 
spectral response of the satellite. 

11.4.2.2 Step 2: Tracer selection from image 
 Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients 
surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness 
temperature of the window. 

11.4.2.3 Step 3: Height assignment 
 Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the 
brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with 
collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will 
be assigned as initial height. 
 Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers. 
 Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique 
mentioned above. 

11.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking 
 The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the 
radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly 
images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. 

11.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images 
(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored 
in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation 
timescales of winds over tropical region.

The evaluation of CMV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
Quantitative assessment of the CMV product is possible from statistical analyses and

collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS 
winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of 
product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in 
objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked

accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to 
the report. 
i) 
Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and 
satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) 
levels together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for 
three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 
20 S. 
ii) 
Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water 
vapor motion vectors through the last 12 months. 
iii) 
Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. 

The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated 
radiosonde report used for verification is given by 
 (VD) = [ (Ui Ur)2 + (Vi Vr)2 ]1/2 
The speed bias is given by

And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally 
reported is 
 N 
 (SD) = [1/N ( (Vdi) (MVD) )2 ]1/2

The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum 
of the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean 
vector difference, 
 (RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 
It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the 
mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the 
squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.

To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report 
mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy 
according to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for 
WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The 
mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. 
11.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If 
the registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. 
However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The 
spatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible 
from geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in 
quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors 
in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to 
obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong 
subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, 
upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. 

1. 
Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed 
retrieval 
This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different 
vertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity 
of atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in 
the assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis 
of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and 
spatial structure of this sensitivity. 

2. 
Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment 
We plan to use IMDs operational regional model output during height assignment 
procedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of 
AMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational 
model, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM 
will be generated over the regions not covered by IMDs regional model. 

3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment 
To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to 
find the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may 
increase the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway 
to develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR 
and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this 
empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. 

4. 
Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods 
for tracking of cloud-tracers. 
The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was 
found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum 
Cloud motion vector

cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is 
significantly faster than MCC.

 12.2 Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Water Vapor Wind 
Vector (WVWV) from INSAT-3D water channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-
3D will have one water vapor channel (6.3 -7.1 (m). In this document some background 
and general characteristic of satellite-derived WVWV products, the methodology employed 
to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and 
outlined the planned validation approach. 
 12.2.1 Overview and background 
In early nineties, forecasters have used extensively the water vapor radiances from geo-
stationary satellites qualitatively (Weldon and Holmes 1991). In quantitative studies, the 
first attempt was made by Hayden and Stewart (Hayden and Stewart 1987) by manually 
tracking moisture features in automated image sequences. Later studies (Laurent 1993, 
Velden 1993, Holmlund 1993) on this area have shown much maturity with ability of 
automated wind extraction methods for producing spatially coherent Water Vapor Wind 
Vector (WVWV) fields comparable in quality to operational cloud-tracked winds. The 
successful implementation of University of Wisconsin-Madison Co-operative Institute for 
Meteorological 
Satellite 
Studies 
(CIMSS) 
automated 
wind-extraction 
algorithm 
operationally at National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) 
have shown considerable improvement in this regards (Nieman et. al 1997). However, the 
quality control (QC) of WVWV fields still demanded intensive manual intervention. In 
1992, NESDIS began the use of first version of new automated winds (CIMSS) software

package and producing full disk wind set without manual intervention since 1997 by 
suitably selecting tracers (filtering undesirable scenes) and assigning heights using several 
methods. The tracking features in subsequent imagery was automated using advanced 
pattern matching techniques (Merrill et al. 1991) and an automated quality control 
algorithm was also implemented. Laurent (1993) reports on Water Vapor (WV) wind 
extraction from Meteosat image data that is carried out under operational conditions. 
Subsequent years further development has been made by adding quality indicators 
(Holmlund 1998) to supply the users with additional information about the products. The 
U.S Geo-stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-8 etc series) are equipped 
with one imager and two sounder water vapor channels. As of GOES-12 the spatial 
resolution of the WV imager has been improved from 8Km to 4 Km at the sub-satellite 
point, and the radiometer is spectrally wider with a central wavelength of 6.5 micro m 
instead 6.7 micro m. The sounders look progressively deeper into the troposphere as the 
spectral band wavelength moves away from the 6.3micro m absorption band center. 
(Menzel et al 1998). This facts opens the opportunity for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of 
atmospheric motions (Menzel 2001). Water vapor winds from image data taken by the WV 
channel aboard the Japanese satellite Geo-stationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS)-5 
have been produced since 1995, and clear-sky WV segments have been separated since 
1998 (Tokuno 1996, 1998). Tokuno et al. (2002) state that the appropriate height 
assignment of clear-sky WV motion vectors is still an unresolved task. 
Geo-stationary satellites of the Fengyun-2 series are operated by the National Satellite 
Meteorological Center of China since 1997 (Xu et al. 1998). These satellites are equipped 
with a water vapor channel as well. The method to evaluate atmospheric motion vectors 
compromises new features (Xu et al. 2002) that are unconventional relative to the earlier 
schemes applied to the data from Meteosat or GOES. 
The study Buche et al. (2006) has shown improvement in Water Vapor structure 
displacements both in smooth and shallow scenes by using proper filters. He then tested a 
series of height assignment methods using altitude-based parameters such as wind shear 
and brightness contrast of pixels. This study reveals that for the cases of strong wind shear 
the methods that use the effective brightness temperature from the coldest pixels lead to 
better height assignments than do others that are based on the contribution function 
explicitly. 
12.2.2 Objective 
The main objective of this study is to derive the water vapor wind vectors over land and sea 
using multiple half hourly Water Vapor images. The region over which the winds are 
derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.

12.4.1 Overview 
The procedure for deriving Water Vapor Wind Vector (WVWV) will be followed the 
basic methods employed for cloud tracking described in Merrill 1989, 1991 with some 
upgrade in Velden et al. 1997. The vertical distribution of WVWV is dependent on 
several key factors: 1) characteristics of the spectral channel, such as central wavelength 
and band width; 2) air-mass characteristics, such as cloudiness and vertical moisture 
profile; 3) season (less moisture in the cool season leads to lower mean heights); and 4) 
latitude (higher moisture content and tropopause in the tropics leads to higher mean 
heights). In regard to the first point, the operational geo-stationary weather satellites with 
water vapor channels (GOES, Meteosat, and GMS) have similar features. The coverage 
attainable from WVWV is quite uniform in most cases, since the observed displacement

of a large portion of the targeted features is a result of pure moisture advection and 
adequately represents the instantaneous wind. The coverage is especially complete in the 
summertime tropics due to the presence of abundant moisture. However there are 
situations when extraction of useful WVWV information is difficult, if not impossible. 
These situations are summarized as: 1) very dry air masses lacking in moisture features, 
which prohibits good target selection; 2) regions of strong vertical motion, in which a 
coherent radiance signal can be significantly attenuated over the tracking interval; 3) 
uniform moisture fields lacking in contrast; 4) strong vertical shear zones, which can be 
deform targets over the tracking interval; and 5) rapidly amplifying extra-tropical 
troughs, which contain a large phase speed component. The above conditions represent 
relatively rare situations when considering full-disk coverage. As a whole the coverage 
and quality of WVWV will vary depending on atmospheric factors such as moisture 
availability and structure, vertical shear, and instrument characteristics such as detector 
precision and resolution. 

12.4.1.1 Methodology 
The main components for the process of WVWV detection are the following: 
 Tracer selection 
 Height assignment 
 Tracking 
 Wind buffer generation and Quality control 

 Before going to details, a crux of such approaches is given in the following steps: 
 The tracer whose displacement is to be detected in subsequent WV image frames 
is selected. 
 Let the source image s and target image t is registered to same scale. For every 
given m x m (typically 32 x 32 pixels) sub-image cs of the tracer in image s, an n x 
n (n > m) search window wt is selected in t. The center co-ordinates of cs and wt 
are identical as s and t are registered to the same scale. 
 Given cs and wt, the problem of detection of WVWV is to find out best correlation 
measure between cs and any one of m x m sub-image within wt. The vector 
originating from the center co-ordinate of cs to the center of best-matched m x m 
sub-image of wt gives the WVWV. 
 The correlation measures are some sort of similarity measure between time 
varying sub-images. This similarity measures can be accomplished either by 
maximum cross-correlation or sum of the squared difference measure or by Nash-
Sutcliffe model efficiency function (Deb et al. 2008).

 The description of each step is given in the following: 

 12.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection: 
At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial 
cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target 
domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any 
gradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also 
undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted 
targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in 
a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify 
the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold 
value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-
directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the 
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-
generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 
1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area 
of 32 X 32 IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial 
coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-
level cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the water vapor channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is 
coarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a 
template) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we 
used 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly 
in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image 
anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

 represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents 
the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally 
produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This 
difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).

12.4.1.1.2 Height assignment 
The height assignments of the selected tracers corresponding to each retrieved vectors are 
derived using the following widely used methods viz. the water vapor histogram method 
(HIST) and the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993). Once final height is selected a 
few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: 

a. Water Vapor Histogram Methods (HIST): 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing 
either infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model 
forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud 
temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess 
field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of 
temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of 
opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level 
(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. 
Semitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual 
movement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in 
these cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud 
emissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are 
warmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high 
in pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at 
the estimated cloud height. 

b. Water VaporInfrared Window Intercept Method (H2O): 
Height assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two 
different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of 
view at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and 
opaque cloud radiances.

 is the opaque ("black") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the

pressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with 
cloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck 
radiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation 
represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at 
a pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current 
atmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model 
forecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an 
observed atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height 
can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 2, observed WV and IR radiances 
at each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different

heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the 
center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface 
and cloud conditions. 

Fig 2: Measured radiances (mW m2 sr1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds 
(Nieman et al., 1993) 
By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount 
is one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. 
The cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric 
Gaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. 
These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances 
can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to 
calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the 
calculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances 
obtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed 
radiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is 
due to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of 
water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between 
the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure 
value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. 
Once the water vapor tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, 
the best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest 
altitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. 
12.4.1.1.3 Tracking: 
If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected 
tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a 
bigger search window, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize 
the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also 
considered. The search area is optimized within 30 degree from the model wind direction at 
that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the 
search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the 
Water vapor wind

189
template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used 
operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. 
However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are 
calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). 
It is defined as

(4) 
Where 
tI and 
sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window 
and 
tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of 
template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of 
the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is 
normalized to values between and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, 
E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 
implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model 
efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of 
E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe 
model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards 
the higher end (e.g. as E 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation 
coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two 
objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main 
advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, 
because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features 
compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of 
mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that 
of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking 
method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean 
region (Deb et al., 2008). 
 12.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control 
Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the 
coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the 
AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the 
retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (Holmlund, 1998) followed at 
EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS 
(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of 
wind buffer generation and quality control procedure is proposed and implemented first time 
in AMV retrieval. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images 
between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a 
file (Fig. 3). The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour 
decorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure 
consists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector 
and degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The 
value of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given 
vector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex

. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-
pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 
neighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness 
characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal 
neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial 
neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. 
The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences
dif

, excluding the 
difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector 
differences 

dif
V
 is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the 
average of 10 
dif
V
 is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is 
determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which 
is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average 
of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from 
final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, 
search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it 
goes to next previous times steps and so on. 
 If S is the mean speed of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different 
quality functions are computed as below :

 All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. 

In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets 
(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they dont get support. 
Hundreds of isolated vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real 
situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the 
past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level 
and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, 
if we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 
UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and 
represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is 
used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the 
second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds 
retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 
04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine 
images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and 
process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of 
valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 
The height assignment of WVWV is a long-standing problem in this regard. In cloud free 
regions, the radiometric signal from pure water vapor structure is a result of emittance over a 
finite layer. It is further complicated by radiance contributions from multiple moist layer 
(Weldon and Holmes 1991). Here the challenge is to assign a height that best represents the 
motion of the feature. In the first step, the instrument measured radiances is converted into 
brightness temperature, which requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the 
Water vapor wind

instrument. It is important to note that the different instruments are sensing radiation from 
slightly different parts of the H2O absorption band. Sampling the center of the absorption 
band (around 6.3m) yields radiation from upper levels of the troposphere. Sampling away 
from the center of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of the troposphere. 

Once the target is selected for tracking, the brightness temperature in the target area is 
averaged and this value will be matched with a collocated model guess temperature profile. 
The level of optimum fit will be used to assign an initial pressure height. 

12.4.2 Operational Implementation 

1.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT 
 In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured 
radiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the 
spectral response of the satellite. 
 It is important that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly 
different parts of H2O absorption band. Sampling the centre of the absorption 
band yields radiation from the upper levels of the troposphere, similarly sampling 
away from the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of 
the atmosphere 

 12.4.2.2 Step 2: Tracer selection from image 
 Water-vapor images tracer selection will be done by evaluating local image 
anomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum 
brightness temperature of the window exceeding some thresholds value. 

12.4.2.3 Step 3: Height assignment 
 Assign height of the selected tracer using water vapor histogram technique. In 
this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and 
matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of 
optimum fit will be assigned as initial height. 
 Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique 
mentioned above. 

12.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking 
 The tracking employs a simple search for the minimum in the sum of squares of 
the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half 
hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. 

12.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images 
(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored 
in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation 
timescales of winds over tropical region. 
 Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer. 
 Again calculate wind speed and direction.

 12.6.2 Methods of validation 
The evaluation of WVWV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
Quantitative assessment of the WVWV product is possible from statistical analyses and 
impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with 
collocated Rawinsondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS 
winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of 
product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in 
objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked 
Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be 
accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to 
the report.

Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between Rawinsondes and 
satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa)

three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20

(ii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water

(iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. 
The Vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind (i) and the collocated Rawinsonde 
(r) used for verification is given by 
 (VD) = [ (Ui Ur)2 + (Vi Vr)2 ]1/2 
The speed bias is given by 

The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is 

And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is 
 N 
 (SD) = [1/N ( (VD) (MVD) )2 ]1/2 
 I=1 
The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of 
the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector 
difference, 
 (RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 
It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean 
component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the 
deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. 

To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean 
vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to 
CGMS guideline for WVWV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds 
should be 7m/s respectively with respect to Rawinsonde observations. The mean bias for 
both sets of winds should be about zero.

12.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. Assuming 
the registration has an error of 1 pixel then error of the final product will be of 5 m/sec. 
However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially 
coherent, high-resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geo-
stationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. WVWV are comparable in quality to 
operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are 
lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able 
information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The 
individual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles 
are possible by using multi-spectral observations.

 Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Visible Winds (VIS) 
from INSAT-3D imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D will have 
one visible channel (0.55 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general 
characteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3D visible 
channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical 
basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 

 13.2.1 Overview and background 

Spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical 
weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed 
time interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the 
cloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies 
and spatiotemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatiotemporal life cycle includes the 
generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. During the 1970s and early 1980s, cloud motion winds were 
produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data 
and Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early 
automated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from visible channels but often 
yielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the 
visible winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In 
the subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition 
techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind 
retrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments 
were made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images.

13.4.1.1 Methodology 

 13.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection and Tracking 

At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial 
cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target 
domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any 
gradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also 
undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted 
targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in 
a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify 
the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold 
value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-
directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the 
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-
generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 
1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected 
templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the 
image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by 
computing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the 
visible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

 represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents 
the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally 
produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This 
difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). 

13.4.1.1.2 Height assignment 
The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are 
derived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. 
such as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). 
Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of 
each method is following: 

2.4 Infrared Window Channel (WIN): 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing 
either infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast 
temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, 
which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the 
target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This 
method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does 
not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), 
resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. 
2.5 Cloud Base Method (BASE): 
Visible wind vectors 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

204
Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or 
altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the 
cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A 
method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to 
estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a 
histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being 
examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the 
histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. 
Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid 
cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy 
distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of 
the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same 
distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud 
base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target 
location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those 
targets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude 
lower than 600 hPa). This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous 
Infrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these 
winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa 
(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). 

Once the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the 
best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) 
value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a 
specific visible tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the 
BASE height is used as the final height. 

 13.4.1.1.3 Tracking 
If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected 
tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a 
bigger search window, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize 
the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also 
considered. The search area is optimized within 30 degree from the model wind direction at 
that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the 
search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the 
template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used 
operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. 
However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are 
calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).

Where 
tI and 
sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window 
and 
tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of 
template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of 
the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is 
normalized to values between and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, 
E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 
implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model 
efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of 
E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe 
model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards 
the higher end (e.g. as E 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation 
coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two 
objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main 
advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, 
because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features 
compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of 
mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that 
of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking 
method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean 
region (Deb et al., 2008). 

13.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control 
Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the 
coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the 
AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the 
retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at 
EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS 
(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of 
wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. 
In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of 
images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1). The 
previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation 
timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a 
coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of 
coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality 
flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its 
surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex 
number

. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-
pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 
neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness 
characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal 
neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial 
neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. 
The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences
dif

, excluding the 
difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector 
differences 

dif
V
 is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the 
average of 10 
dif
V
 is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is 
determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which 
is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average 
of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from 
final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, 
search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it 
goes to next previous times steps and so on.

 All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. 
In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets 
(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they dont get support. 
Hundreds of isolated vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real 
situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the 
past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level 
and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, 
if we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 
UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and 
represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is 
used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the 
second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds 
retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 
04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine 
images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and 
process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of 
valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 

13.4.2 Operational Implementation 

13.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image 
 Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly 
surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness 
temperature of the window. 

13.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment 
 Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the 
brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with 
collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will 
be assigned as initial height.

 Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique 
mentioned above. 

13.4.2.3 Step 3: Tracking 
 The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the 
radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half 
hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. 

13.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images 
(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored 
in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation 
timescales of winds over tropical region.

 13.6.2 Methods of validation 

The evaluation of VIS winds should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative 
measures. Quantitative assessment of the VIS winds product is possible from statistical 
analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching 
observations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according 
to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed 
measure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation 
weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on 
Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production 
quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The 
recommended three parts to the report. 
i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and 
satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels 
together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude 
bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. 
ii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water 
vapor motion vectors through the last 12 months. 
 iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. 
The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated 
radiosonde report used for verification is given by 
 (VD) = [ (Ui Ur)2 + (Vi Vr)2 ]1/2 
The speed bias is given by 

The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is 

And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally 
reported is 
 N 
 (SD) = [1/N ( (Vdi) (MVD) )2 ]1/2 
 I=1 
The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum 
of the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean 
vector difference, 
 (RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 
It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the 
mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the 
squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. 

 N 
(BIAS)i = 1/N [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ] 
 i=1 
 N 
(MVD) = 1/N (VD)i 
 i=1

To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report 
mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy 
according to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for 
WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The 
mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. 
13.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If 
the registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. 
However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The 
spatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible 
from geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. VIS wind are comparable in 
quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors 
in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to 
obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong 
subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, 
upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. 

1. 
Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed 
retrieval 
This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different 
vertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity 
of atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in 
the assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis 
of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and 
spatial structure of this sensitivity. 

2. 
Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment 
We plan to use IMDs operational regional model output during height assignment 
procedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of 
AMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational 
model, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM 
will be generated over the regions not covered by IMDs regional model. 

3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment 
To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to 
find the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may 
increase the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway 
to develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR

and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this 
empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. 

4. 
Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods 
for tracking of cloud-tracers. 
The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was 
found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum 
cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is 
significantly faster than MCC.

Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Mid-Infrared Winds 
(MIR) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation procedure. The 
INSAT-3D will have one MIR channel (3.8 4.0 m). In this document some background 
and general characteristic of satellite-derived winds from mid-infrared channels 
characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and 
practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 

14.2.1 Overview and background 

Spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical 
weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed 
time interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the 
cloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies 
and spatiotemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatiotemporal life cycle includes the 
generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. During the 1970s and early 1980s, cloud motion winds were 
produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data 
and Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early 
automated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from mid-infrared channel but often 
yielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the mid-
infrared winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In 
the subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition 
techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind 
retrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments 
were made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images. 
Generally, atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) wind coverage has been diurnally consistent 
in the mid to upper-levels (100-600 hPa) by the use of 6.7 m water vapor and 10.7 m long-

wave infrared (LWIR) channels. However, in the low-levels (600-950 hPa), AMVs are 
retrieved using a combination of the visible and LWIR channels, depending on the time of 
day. The visible channel provides far superior low-level tracer detection than the LWIR 
channel. This is due to its finer spatial resolution and decreased susceptibility to attenuation 
by low-level moisture. Unfortunately, nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage typically 
decreases sharply when visible channel is not available. This creates a situation of overall 
reduced wind information for the user during night-time. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) 3.9 
m channel on the INSAT-3D satellite, MIR cloud-drift winds have been developed to 
provide improved nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage. The MIR channel is slightly 
more sensitive to warmer temperatures and less sensitive to thin cirrus than the 10.7 m long-
wave infrared (LWIR) channel traditionally used to track low-level clouds at night. This 
allows for a higher detectability rate of low-level (600-950 hPa) cloud tracers in the MIR 
channel. Improved low-level nighttime wind coverage can provide forecasters with more 
wind data as well as reduce the diurnal inconsistencies that may be a challenge to data 
assimilation into models. 
14.2.2 Objective 
The main objective of this study is to derive the Mid-Infrared Winds (MIR) over sea using 
multiple successive half hourly MIR images. The region over which the winds are derived 
should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.

14.4.1 Overview 
14.4.1.1 Methodology 
 14.4.1.1.1 Solar Contamination in MIR Channel 
The MIIR channel is susceptible to solar contamination during daytime due to its proximity 
to the visible spectrum. Cirrus clouds are somewhat reflective of solar radiation and cumulus 
clouds are highly reflective in the MIR channel. Since low-level cumulus clouds are the main 
source of targets for low-level cloud-drift winds, this reflectance causes tracking problems 
due to saturation effects. The reflected solar energy received at the INSAT-3D sensor from 
the cumulus clouds can make them appear to be warmer than even the underlying ocean 
surface at times. This makes tracer selection extremely difficult and erroneous. Therefore, the 
usefulness of this channel for winds derivation to be limited to nighttime applications 
because of its sensitivity to solar contamination. 

 14.4.1.1.2 MIR Image Enhancements 
The MIR channel is characterized by relatively small gradients in brightness temperatures in 
the warmer low levels. This limits the ability of the tracking algorithm to detect viable cloud 
targets and resultant tracers over time. A technique was developed at CIMSS (Velden and 
Dunion 2001) to enhance the MIR imagery by stretching the brightness temperature contrast 
in the warmer end of the spectrum (low levels). Specifically, the brightness temperature 
range from 50-160 is stretched. This enhancement greatly improves the gradients in the low-
levels at the cost of confining the mid to upper-level gradients in the image. Therefore, tracer 
detection is strictly limited to cloud tracers 600 hPa (based on brightness temperature 
determined heights). The image enhancement technique is performed on the MIR images 
used to track the cloud features. 
 14.4.1.1.3 Tracer selection 
At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial 
cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target 
domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any 
gradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also 
undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted 
targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in 
a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify 
Mid infra-red wind vectors

218
the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold 
value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-
directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the 
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-
generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 
1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected 
templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the 
image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by 
computing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the 
mid-infrared images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

 represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents 
the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally 
produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This 
difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). 

14.4.1.1.4 Height assignment 
The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are 
derived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. 
such as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). 
Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of 
each method is following: 

Infrared Window Channel (WIN): 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing 
either infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast 
temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, 
which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the 
target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This 
method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does 
not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), 
resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. 

Cloud Base Method (BASE): 
Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or 
altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the 
cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A 
method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to 
estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a 
histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being 
examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the 
histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. 
Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid 
cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy

219
distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of 
the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same 
distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud 
base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target 
location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those 
targets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude 
lower than 600 hPa). This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous 
Infrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these 
winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa 
(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). 

Once the mid-infrared tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, 
the best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest 
altitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. 
However, if for a specific tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, 
then the BASE height is used as the final height. 

 14.4.1.1.5 Tracking 
If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected 
tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a 
bigger search window, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize 
the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also 
considered. The search area is optimized within 30 degree from the model wind direction at 
that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the 
search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the 
template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used 
operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. 
However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are 
calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). 
It is defined as 

n
i
t

(2) 
Where 
tI and 
sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window 
and 
tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of 
template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of 
the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is 
normalized to values between and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, 
E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 
implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model 
efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of 
E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe 
model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards 
the higher end (e.g. as E 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation

220
coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two 
objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main 
advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, 
because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features 
compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of 
mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that 
of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking 
method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean 
region (Deb et al., 2008). 

14.4.1.1.6 Wind buffer generation and Quality control 
Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the 
coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the 
AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the 
retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at 
EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS 
(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of 
wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. 
In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of 
images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1). The 
previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation 
timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a 
coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of 
coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality 
flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its 
surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex 
number

. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-
pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 
neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness 
characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal 
neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial 
neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. 
The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences
dif

, excluding the 
difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector 
differences 

dif
V
 is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the 
average of 10 
dif
V
 is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is 
determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which 
is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average 
of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from 
final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, 
search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it 
goes to next previous times steps and so on.

 All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. 
In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets 
(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they dont get support. 
Hundreds of isolated vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real 
situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the 
past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level 
and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, 
if we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 
UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and 
represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is 
used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the 
second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds 
retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 
04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine 
images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and 
process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of 
valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 

14.4.2 Operational Implementation 

14.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image 
 Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly 
surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness 
temperature of the window. 

14.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment 
 Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the 
brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with 
collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will 
be assigned as initial height. 
 Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique 
mentioned above. 

14.4.2.3 Step 3: Tracking 
 The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the 
radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly 
images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. 

14.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images 
(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored

in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation

weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on 
Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production 
quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The 
recommended three parts of the report. 

i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and 
satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels 
together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude 
bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. 
ii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water 
vapor motion vectors through the last 12 months. 
 iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. 

The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated 
radiosonde report used for verification is given by 
 (VD) = [ (Ui Ur)2 + (Vi Vr)2 ]1/2 

The speed bias is given by 

The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is 

And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally 
reported is 
 N 
 (SD) = [1/N ( (Vdi) (MVD) )2 ]1/2 
 I=1 
The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum 
of the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean 
vector difference, 
 (RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 
It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the 
mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the 
squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.

To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean 
vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to 
CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should 
be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of 
winds should be about zero.

Technical Issues (Limitations etc) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the 
registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However 
the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, 
high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds is possible from geostationary satellite 
remote sensing of water vapor. MIR wind is comparable in quality to operational upper-level 
cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining 
moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely 
dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent 
single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-
spectral observations. 

1. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval 

This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different 
vertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity 
of atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in 
the assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis 
of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and 
spatial structure of this sensitivity. 

2.Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment 

We plan to use IMDs operational regional model output during height assignment 
procedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of 
AMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational 
model, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM 
will be generated over the regions not covered by IMDs regional model. 

3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment 

To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to 
find the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may 
increase the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway 
to develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR 
and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this 
empirical model will then be used in real-time applications.

tracking of cloud-tracers. 

The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was 
found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum 
cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is 
significantly faster than MCC.

UTH Baseline Document 
 15.2 Introduction 
Upper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) is an estimate of the mean relative humidity of the 
atmosphere between approximately 600 hPa and 300 hPa. UTH is basically a measure of 
weighted mean of relative humidity according to the weighting function of the water 
vapour channel. Therefore, UTH is more likely a representative of the relative humidity 
around the atmospheric layer where weighting function of water vapour channel peaks 

15.2.1 Overview and background 
Upper tropospheric humidity from satellite measurements is useful to monitor changes in 
water vapour in the upper troposphere on a global and regional scale. Several methods 
have been developed for retrieving UTH from water vapour channel measurements 
(Schmetz and Turpeinen, 1988; Soden and Bretherton, 1993, 1996; Stephens et al, 1996). 
Changes in relative humidity around this layer would contribute maximum to the changes 
in the radiances received in this channel. 

UTH extraction is in principle the calculation of single-column values for the upper 
tropospheric humidity. The physics involved is the quantitative description of the transfer 
of the WV channel radiances from the radiation emitting surface through the atmosphere 
towards the satellite as calculated by radiative transfer model. The transfer calculations 
are performed for a set of different constant humidity values for the upper tropospheric 
atmosphere for standard atmosphere representing different months/seasons. Empirical 
coefficients generated for different months are then used to derive from the IR and WV 
radiation measured by the satellite to estimate an average of the upper tropospheric 
humidity that caused the emitted radiation to be attenuated to the values measured. Only 
the pixels of surface and low cloud clusters are used, excluding the pixels of 
contamination with medium and high cloud clusters from the processing.

15.4.1 Overview 
Standard tropical atmospheric profile has been used to simulate VHRR radiances using 
SBDART model. Filter response function for the INSAT-3A/ Kalpana-1 WV channel 
was provided as input to the SABDART. Standard profile was modified by replacing 
specific humidity at levels above 600 hPa to represent constant relative humidty ranging 
from 2 to 100% with the interval of 2%. Satellite zenith angle was varied from 0 to 75 
degrees at an interval of 5 degree for each constant relative humidity profile. Radiances 
were simulated for each set of profile and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (100 km) 
from SBDART for VHRR WV channel. Brightness temperature is computed from 
simulated radiances using the following relationship: 

 Tb6.7 = A/ ln{(B/R) + 1} 

Where, A and B are constants, Tb is Brightness Temperature in K and R is Radiance in 
mW/cm2/Sr/. 

A bilinear regression relationship is established between ln{uth/cos()} and water 
vapour channel brightness temperature Tb6.7 in the form: 
Ln{UTH/cos()}= a + b.Tb6.7 ---- (1) 
Where, is the satellite zenith angle of the corresponding pixel, and a and b are the 
regression coefficients. We obtain the following relationship for the UTH with satellite 
zenith angle and measured brightness temperature (Fig.1): 

UTH = cos() * exp(-a1* Tb6.7 + b1) for Tb6.7 < 240.0 ----- (2a) 
(with R2 = 0.9965) 
And, 
UTH = cos() * exp(-a2 * Tb6.7 + b2) for TbWV > 240.0 ----- (2b) 
(with R2 = 0.9989)

Fig.1 INSAT WV Brightness Temperature vs UTH 

The algorithm uses water vapour channel of the INSAT-3A/Kalpana-1 VHRR (5.7-7.1) 
to estimate the upper tropospheric humidity in absence of middle and upper level clouds. 
The generation of the UTH product is directly based on the WV brightness temperatures. 
Each water vapour image is converted into different segments of 16 x 16 pixels as the 
averaging would reduce the error in measurements and also helps removes the pixels with 
partial cloud cover. The WV image pixels of each segment not belonging to 
contamination with medium and high cloud clusters are averaged (if there are any, 
otherwise no UTH value is derived for such a segment). Presently, pixels with middle and 
upper clouds are removed using a threshold value of IR brightness temperature of 270 K. 
Additionally, if UTH value exceeds 110%, then pixel is assumed to be cloud 
contaminated. However, this approach needs further modification. These segment WV 
brightness temperatures are used to derive an upper tropospheric relative humidity by 
using the empirical relation (2). 

Brightness temperatures depend strongly upon the satellite zenith angle since it increases 
the path length for the radiances reaching the satellite. Therefore, zenith angle is 
computed for each segment to be used with the regression equation. Satellite zenith 
angles are computed for every pixel using satellite-observer geometry using the following 
formula:

15.4.2.1 
Radiative Transfer Model 

SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) model developed by 
Ricchiazzi et al (1998) at University of California will be used for INSAT-3A/Kalpana 
and INSAT-3D VHRR radiance simulations. SBDART is designed for the analysis of a 
wide variety of radiative transfer problems encountered in satellite remote sensing and 
atmospheric energy budget studies. SBDART is based on a collection of highly 
developed and reliable physical models developed by the atmospheric science community. 
A brief description to the key components of the model are discussed below: 
Cloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earths climate by reflecting visible 
radiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-
radiating it back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy 
atmosphere requires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, 
and the asymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART 
contains an internal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie 
scattering code and covers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to 
128um. By default, the angular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple 
Henyey-Greenstein parameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input 
as desired. 
Gas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed 
for the LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis, 
1986). These models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmisson from 0 to 50000 cm-1 
and include the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's 
atmosphere. The models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were 
degraded to 20 cm-1 resolutions for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength 
resolution of about 5 nm in the visible and about 200 nm in the thermal infrared. A 
capability to read high-resolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is 
introduced in SBDART version 2.0 which is less convenient to use than the standard 
approach. However, it has the advantage of removing limitations in the ultimate spectral 
resolution available with SBDART. 
Extraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar 
spectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models 
used in 5s (Tanre, 1988) or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum. 
Standard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from 
the 5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions: 
tropical, midlatitude summer, midlatitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and 
US62. These model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the 
atmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure, 
temperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own 
model atmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as 
CO2 or CH4 are assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the 
user) of the total particle density. 
Standard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several 
common boundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the 
Upper tropospheric humidity 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

237
user can select from rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of 
boundary layer aerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorologic visibility 
at 0.55 m and an internal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5 
aerosol layers can be specified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged 
volcanic, meteoric and the climatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol 
models included in SBDART were derived from those provided in the 5s and 
LOWTRAN7. 
Radiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically 
integrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988). 
The discrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the 
equations of plane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. 
The intensity of both scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at 
different heights and directions. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric 
layers and 40 radiation streams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes). 
Surface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall 
radiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water, 
vegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface. 
The spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by 
combinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and 
sand can be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth, 
or deciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity 
of water with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil. 

The diverse profiles datasets are used to construct monthly average temperature and 
humidity profiles over INSAT observation area. Monthly averaged profiles are used to 
minimize the uncertainties due to seasonal variation of upper tropospheric temperature on 
UTH computation. For each month the average profile is perturbed by replacing water 
vapour at each levels between 600-200 hPa to make the relative humidity (RH) a constant 
value (=2, 4, 6.100%) throughout the layer 600-200hPa and falls off linearly to ~0 
from 200 hPa to 100 hPa in each of the perturbed profiles. Temperature and ozone 
profiles are kept same for each perturbed profile in each month and only water vapour is 
changed above 600 hPa level. Since each level between 600-200hPa has same RH value, 
the weighted average value, i.e. UTH is equal to RH for each perturbed profile. Water 
vapour channel brightness temperatures for each perturbed profile at different zenith 
angle (0, 5, 10..60) are simulated using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric 
Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model (Ricchiazzi, Yang, Gautier, & Sowle, 1998). The 
radiative transfer computations are carried out separately for each satellite (INSAT-3A, 
Kalpana, and INSAT-3D) using sensor response functions of water vapour channels for 
simulating realistic satellite radiances. For each profile, the main inputs for the radiative 
transfer computations are: atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapour, and ozone 
concentrations. These simulations are carried out for average profiles corresponding to 
different months. Regression analysis is carried out separately for each satellite and each 
months independently and the regression coefficients are obtained between 
[UTH/cos()] and water vapour channel brightness temperature, where is zenith angle.

15.4.3 Operational Implementation 
15.4.2.1 
Step 1 : Conversion of Grey count to Brightness temperature : 
The grey count values in the IR and WV geo-corrected files are converted into the 
brightness temperature values using the static look-up table file, which is generated 
during characterization of the instruments on the ground before launch. This LUT file is 
provided along with the data set. 

15.4.2.2 
Step 2 : Cloud detection: 
All the data in the cold space and data falling beyond the 60 radius from the sub-satellite 
points are excluded from further calculations. Cloudy pixels are identified and these 
pixels are also excluded from further calculations. The threshold used to eliminate the 
cloudy pixel is that if brightness temperature of thermal IR window channel is less than 
or equal to 270 and if the UTH calculated at that pixel is > 110 then it is a cloudy pixel, 
and hence eliminated. In the 5 x 5 pixel box, if the number of cloudy pixels is more than 
75 % than the whole box is considered as cloudy and excluded from UTH retrieval. 

15.4.2.3 
Step 3: Zenith angle calculation: 
After the cloudy pixels are discarded then the zenith angle is calculated for the pixels 
using Equation (3). 

15.4.2.4 
Step 4 : UTH retrieval: 
Using the above calculated zenith angle and the UTH coefficients for corresponding 
satellite and month of the observation, UTH is calculated from Equation (2) using the 
water vapour channel brightness temperature. UTH is generated for every 5 x 5 pixel box.

15.6.2 Methods of validation 

Radiosonde profiles and NCEP analysis profiles of water vapour are converted into upper 
tropospheric humidity (UTH) estimates using water vapour channel weighting function of 
the satellite concerned. UTH is weighted average of relative humidity weighted by the 
water vapour weighting function at each atmospheric level. These estimates of observed 
UTH are compared with the collocated satellite retrieved UTH. 
These estimates of UTH can also be compared with retrieved product of Meteosat 
satellite located over Indian Ocean region. Because the extracted UTH product is 
dependent on the WV channel calibration, these UTH/radiosonde comparisons may also 
provide a method of checking the actual WV calibration coefficients. Brightness 
temperature observations of satellite WV channels may also be used with simulated 
brightness temperature from collocated radiosonde profile to compute the bias correction 
coefficients in the RT model. 
 15.7 Technical issues ( limitation etc.) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the 
satellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept 
in mind. 

i) It is assumed that upper tropospheric temperature does not deviate by a large 
amount from the mean monthly profile. 
ii) Satellite receives only a negligible amount of radiance emitted from layers beneath 
600 hPa. The atmosphere above 200 hPa is represented by decreasing the relative 
humidity to 0% at 100 hPa, which seems to be a reasonable assumption consistent 
with the structure of standard profiles and observations. 
iii) The reason for using mean monthly profiles of water vapour at lower levels as 
input to the radiative transfer model is that these levels contribute very little to the 
outgoing radiance. 
 15.8 Future Scope 
These coefficients can be improved with the availability of more accurate radiation 
models in future. UTH algorithm in future may include the upper tropospheric mean 
temperature derived from model forecast to minimize the uncertainties due to the 
temperature variations in the 600-200 hPa layer.

Introduction 
INSAT-3D will carry an 18-channel infrared Sounder (plus a visible channel) along with a 6 
channel Imager. 
This algorithm is designed for retrieving vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and 
moisture along with total column ozone content in the atmoshere from clear sky infrared 
radiances in different absorption bands observed through INSAT-3D. INSAT-3D Sounder 
channels are similar to those in GOES-12 Sounder and many of the spectral bands are similar 
to High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) onboard NOAA-ATOVS. Hence, 
present algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is adapted from the operational HIRS and GOES 
algorithms developed by Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), 
University of Wisconsin. 
This module also describes the background to retrieval problem, theoretical basis of the 
retrieval algorithm for vertical profiles, practical aspects of algorithm implementation, and 
outline of the planned validation approach. INSAT-3D Sounder instrument characteristics are 
given in the appendix-1 at the end. 

16.2.1 Overview and Background: 
INSAT-3D Sounder observations will provide vertical profiles of temperature and humidity 
in clear-sky conditions besides total column ozone and various other derived products. 
Atmospheric profile retrieval algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is a two-step approach. The 
first step includes generation of accurate hybrid first guess profiles using combination of 
statistical regression retrieved profiles and model forecast profiles. The second step is 
nonlinear physical retrieval to improve the resulting first guess profile using Newtonian 
iterative method.

The retrievals will be performed using clear sky radiances measured by Sounder within a 5x5 
field of view (approximately 50 km resolution) over land and ocean for both day and night. 
Four sets of regression coefficients will be generated. Two sets for land and ocean daytime 
conditions and the other two sets for land and ocean night-time conditions using a training 
dataset comprising historical radiosonde observations representing atmospheric conditions 
over INSAT-3D observation region. 
The retrieval algorithm discussed here is adapted from CIMSS algorithm for GOES-Sounder 
and is primarily based on the retrieval algorithms of Li et al. (2000), Ma et al. (1999), Smith 
and Woolf (1988) and Hayden (1988). Temperature and moisture profiles at Sounder 
resolution are required for numerical weather prediction in short to medium range besides 
various other weather and climate applications. High temporal resolution of sounding data 
from geostationary satellite INSAT-3D will provide a wealth of new information on 
atmospheric structure in clear-sky conditions. Retrieval of atmospheric profiles at high 
spatial and temporal resolutions will immensely improve mesoscale prediction. 

16.2.2 History of atmospheric sounding 
King (1956) was first to suggest that atmospheric temperature profiles could be inferred from 
satellite observations of thermal infrared emission and explained the feasibility of retrieving 
the temperature profile from the satellite intensity scan measurements. Further advances were 
made for the temperature-sounding concept when Kaplan demonstrated (1959) that vertical 
profile of temperature could be inferred from the spectral distribution of emission by 
atmospheric gases. He suggested that observations in the wings of a spectral band sense 
deeper regions of the atmosphere; whereas observations in the band center see only the very 
top layer of the atmosphere. Thus by properly selecting a set of sounding spectral channels at 
different wavelengths in the absorption band, the observed radiances could be used to 
estimate the vertical temperature profile in the atmosphere. 
Following a proposal by Wark (1961) for satellite vertical sounding program to measure 
atmospheric temperature profiles, the first satellite-sounding instrument (SIRS-A) was 
launched on NIMBUS-3 in 1969 (Wark et al., 1970). NOAA launched the TIROS 
Operational Vertical Sounder in 1978 (TOVS, Smith et al. 1979), consisting of High-
resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), and the 
Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) onboard satellites NOAA-6 to NOAA-14. HIRS provides 
17 km spatial resolution at nadir with 19 infrared sounding channels (4-15), whereas MSU 
provides 109 km resolution at nadir with 4 microwave channels (~50 GHz). SSU has 3 
channels in the far IR (~15) for stratospheric measurements. Current NOAA series satellites 
NOAA-15 and NOAA-16 (and future satellite in the NOAA series) have ATOVS with 
HIRS/3, and MSU and SSU have been replaced by AMSU-A and AMSU-B to improve the 
temperature and humidity sounding. HIRS/3 has the same spectral bands as the HIRS/2. 
AMSU-A uses 15 microwave channels around 23, 30, 50 and 90 GHz of oxygen absorption 
bands with resolution of 50 km at nadir. AMSU-B uses 5 microwave channels around 90, 
150 and 190 GHz with a horizontal resolution of 17 km at nadir. 
New generation of infrared atmospheric sounder is the hyper-spectral sounder with thousands 
of channels instead of few tens of infrared bands. Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) 
onboard EOS-Aqua satellite was launched on May 4, 2002 and is providing a wealth of 
highly accurate atmospheric and surface information using 2378 high-spectral-resolution 
Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder

247
infrared (3.7 15.4 ) channels with horizontal resolution of 10 km at nadir. AIRS along 
with AMSU forms a state-of-art atmospheric sounding tool for temperature profiles with 
accuracy of 1 C in a 1 km thick layer and humidity profile with an accuracy of 20% in 2 km 
thick layer in the troposphere. Aqua satellite also has MODIS with very high spatial 
resolution of 1 km and is providing the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. 
Recently, METOP satellite was launched carrying a hyper-spectral sounder IASI onboard 
with > 8400 channels and mission objective to achieve the temperature and humidity profiles 
accuracy of 1C and 10% in 1 km and 2km layers, respectively. 
The first sounding instrument in geostationary orbit was the GOES VISSR Atmospheric 
Sounder (VAS, Smith et al. 1981) launched in 1980. This was followed by GOES-8 Sounder 
(Menzel and Purdom, 1994) that provides 8 km spatial resolution with 18 infrared sounding 
channels. Current satellite of this series, GOES-13, is launched recently in May 2006. Future 
satellite GOES-R of this series to be launched in 2012 will have a Hyperspectral 
Environmental Suite (HES) to provide high spectral resolution in the infrared and a high 
spatial resolution mode for mesoscale sounding capability. Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) 
onboard GOES-R will be similar to the current polar orbiting EOS-MODIS. NASA and 
NOAA are planning to launch Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer 
(GIFTS) that will revolutionize our ability to measure, understand and predict the earth-
atmosphere system. 
16.2.3 Objective 
Objective of the present module is to describe the algorithms and different aspects associated 
with the retrieval of temperature, humidity profiles and total column ozone from INSAT-3D 
Sounder observation in 18 infrared spectral bands. Present document also outlines the

16.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
16.4.1 Overview 
In this section, detailed theoretical aspects of the sounding retrieval are discussed. INSAT-3D 
Sounder retrieval scheme involves two-step approach. In first step, first-guess temperature 
and humidity profiles are derived based on regression retrieval combined with model 
forecast. In the second step, accurate temperature and humidity profiles are retrieved based 
on physical retrieval procedure that uses non-linear Newtonian iterative method to adjust first 
guess profiles. Ozone profile and integrated amount is retrieved using regression retrieval 
and used as first guess for the physical retrieval routine. 
16.4.1.1 
Theoretical Background 
Atmospheric sounding is one of the most important applications of satellite measurements in 
meteorology, which involves retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and trace-gas 
concentrations, especially water vapor and ozone, using observations at wavelengths that 
have significant attenuation in atmosphere. For this we need to know the variation of 
temperature with altitude, and the variation of the density of atmospheric gases with altitude, 
such as carbon dioxide, water vapor and ozone. Water vapor is important because of its 
meteorological impact and its importance for atmospheric correction in thermal infrared 
measurements.

Atmospheric sounding techniques exploit all three phenomena that that play important role in 
radiative transfer: namely absorption, scattering and thermal emission. Most observations are 
made in the thermal infrared and microwave bands. At infrared wavelengths scattering due to 
atmospheric gases is negligible, hence it is not considered in the radiative transfer process. 
For vertical sounding at infrared wavelengths the significant terms in the radiative transfer 
equation (RTE) are absorption and thermal emission. This simplification is called 
Schwartzchilds equation. Here, we will consider only cloud-free conditions. If a sensor 
views vertically downwards into the atmosphere at a wavelength at which the atmosphere is 
optically thick, the brightness temperature/radiances that are received by sensor will be 
characteristic of the atmosphere at a depth below the sensor that is of the order of the 
absorption length. Thus for bigger absorption coefficient, the absorption length is smaller and 
hence the temperature signal is received from higher altitude. So by making observations at a 
number of wavelengths near a broad absorption line, different altitudes in the atmosphere can 
be investigated. Thermal infrared temperature profilers normally employ the broad and deep 
CO2 lines near 15 m wavelengths. 
Radiative transfer equation in the non-scattering case may be written in simple form as: 
Where, 

-Surface emissivity 
(p0) 
-Vertical transmittance from level with pressure p to space 
T(p) 

-vertical profile of temperature and 
B[T(p)] 
-corresponding Planck function profile. 
This equation implies that the radiance received at a particular wavelength is sum of three 
terms on the right hand side: first term is upwelling radiance from the surface, second term is 
direct atmospheric emission term and the third term is reflected downward atmospheric 
emission reaching at satellite sensor. (/p) is called a weighting function. It weights the 
Planck function in the atmospheric component of the emitted radiation. It specifies the layer 
from which the radiation emitted to space originates, and hence it determines the region of 
the atmosphere that can be sensed from space at this wavelength. Fig.1 shows the 
transmittance profiles and corresponding weighting functions at three wavelengths for which 
the atmospheric absorption is different. Since the weighting function is the derivative of the 
transmittance profile, it will peak higher in the atmosphere for the wavelengths at which the 
absorption is stronger. In this way, if the atmosphere is observed at a number of carefully 
chosen wavelengths, whose weighting functions sample the atmosphere, then it is possible to 
retrieve the Plancks function B(T) and thereby the temperature T itself. 
To explain this form of weighting functions, we consider the emission to space from air 
parcels of unit volume at different heights in the atmosphere. The radiation emitted to space 
is determined by three factors: temperature of the air parcel, number density of emitting gas, 
and transmittance of the atmosphere from the air parcel to space. For the lowest parcel, the 
atmospheric density is high and so the amount of radiation emitted is high, but most of the 
radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere above it and very little reaches space. For the highest 
parcel, the transmittance to space is high, but comparatively little radiation is emitted because

atmospheric density decreases exponentially with height. These two contrasting effects 
combine in such a way that, at some intermediate height, the contribution of a parcel to the 
radiation reaching space is a maximum. The variation of the radiance to space as a function 
of height is shown by the curve on the right of the Fig.1. 
Most of the radiation to space originates in a layer around the peak of weighting function. 
From the knowledge of atmospheric composition and spectroscopic parameters we can 
calculate where in the atmosphere this layer will be. Then the intensity of the radiation can be 
interpreted in terms of the mean temperature of the layer. Using radiation at different 
frequencies for which the absorption strength is different, we can build a group of weighting 
functions, which provide information on the mean temperatures of many such layers, thus 
leading to the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profile from a set of multi-frequency 
measurements. 
It is important to note that the weighting functions are broad, implying that the satellite 
instrument can sense the mean properties of broad layers very well, but it is only able to 
sense the characteristics of single levels or narrow layers insofar as they are correlated with 
the properties of the broad layers. Broad nature of the weighting functions restricts the 
capability of satellite sounders to detect small-scale vertical structure of the atmospheric. 
Infrared sounder channels have spectral widths typically hundreds of times greater than the 
atmospheric absorption lines. Therefore they average frequencies for which the absorption 
strengths are very different. This has the effect of broadening the weighting functions 
considerably. By using instruments of much higher spectral resolution, such as 
interferometers or grating spectrometers (e.g. AIRS, IASI), it is possible to achieve spectral 
resolutions closer to the widths of the atmospheric absorption lines. In this way instruments 
with several thousand channels and much sharper weighting functions can be built. 
In order for atmospheric temperature to be inferred from measurements of thermal emission, 
the source of emission must be a relatively abundant gas of known and uniform distribution. 
Otherwise, the uncertainty in the abundance of the gas will make ambiguous the 
determination of temperature from the measurements. Carbon dioxide is one such gas in the

atmosphere having uniform known mixing ratio for altitudes below about 100 km, and has 
emission bands in the spectral regions that are convenient for measurement, e.g. 15m. 
The forward problem: 
The instrument makes measurements of radiance in a number of channels i. For each 
channel, we can write a radiative transfer equation (excluding reflection term): 

This equation expresses the forward problem for the channel, i.e. given the state of the 
atmosphere; the solution of this equation gives us the radiance incident at the satellite in this 
channel. Using the radiances measured by the satellite radiometers, we can determine some 
information directly. For well-mixed gases such CO2, we assume that the mixing ratio is 
known and independent of height. Wavelengths that are sensitive to these gases are used to 
retrieve atmospheric temperature. For wavelengths sensitive to variable trace gases, such as 
water vapor and O3, we assume that the temperature profile is known and use the radiances to 
retrieve mixing ratios. Unfortunately, no wavelengths are completely free of absorption by 
the variable trace gases; this contributes to errors in retrieving temperatures. Also, errors in 
our knowledge of temperature profiles lead to errors in trace-gas retrievals. 
The above equations are strictly applicable only at a single wavelength, but satellite 
instruments sense a band of wavelengths. So the equation must be integrated over 
wavelength using the spectral response function for each channel as a weight. This can be 
very time-consuming. To overcome this problem, regression based fast transmittance models 
are formulated, in which the atmosphere is divided into predetermined layers, and the 
transmittance of each layer, averaged over the response function of the radiometer is 
calculated. Then the functions of temperature, humidity and zenith angle are fitted to the 
results to generate regression coefficients for the fast model. 
The inverse problem: 
Inverse problem in the satellite meteorology is to obtain the state of the atmosphere (in terms 
of its vertical profiles of temperature and constituents) from the radiance measurements. 
Since we have a limited number of channels the inversion of equation is ill posed or under-
constrained. This means that there exist an infinite number of profiles that satisfy a given set 
of measurements. This is because the atmospheric state (unknown, e.g. temperature profile) 
is a continuous function of height, and measurements are from a finite number of channels. 
Inverse problem is to find one that is reasonable and, if possible, to find the profile which is 
best or most reasonable in some sense. In addition, the measurements always contain some 
error or "noise". This further increases the ill-posed nature of the problem, and we must find 
a method of solution that does not amplify the noise to an unacceptable degree. This implies 
that we need information additional to the measurements in order to reach a solution. For 
atmospheric remote sensing, additional information is available in the form of numerical 
model forecast and surface observation analysis. 
There are several approaches for solution of this problem:

2. Statistical retrievals and 
3. Hybrid retrieval 
In a physical retrieval, the forward problem is exploited in an iterative procedure: 
1. A first-guess temperature profile is chosen. 
2. The weighting functions are calculated. 
3. The forward problem is solved to yield estimates of the radiance in each channel. 
4. If computed radiances match the observed ones (within noise) then the current profile 
is accepted as the solution. 
5. If convergence is not achieved, the current profile is adjusted. 
6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until a solution is found. 
An advantage of this approach is that physical processes are clearly evident at each stage. 
The disadvantages are that the method is computationally intensive and it requires accurate 
knowledge about the transmittances. It also does not exploit the known statistical properties 
of the atmosphere. 
In statistical retrieval, a training dataset, comprising radiosonde observations that are nearly 
coincident in time and space with satellite soundings are compiled. A relationship between 
the observed radiances and atmospheric profiles is established. In this approach physical 
processes are embedded in the statistics. 
Advantages of this approach are (1) the actual retrievals are computationally simple (does not 
use RTE) and (2) it requires no knowledge of the transmittances. It only uses the statistical 
properties of the atmosphere. The disadvantage is that a large training data set is necessary. 
Hybrid retrieval methods are in between the first two approaches. They are much like 
statistical retrievals, but they do not require a large training dataset. They use weighting 
functions like physical retrievals, but they do not directly involve integration of the RTE. 
Hybrid methods are easier to apply than the statistical or physical methods. They require 
knowledge of the transmittances, and they employ statistical knowledge of the atmosphere. 
To summarize, there is no unique solution for the detailed vertical profile of temperature or 
an absorbing constituent because: 
a. 
The outgoing radiances arise from relatively deep layers of the atmosphere, 
b. 
The radiances observed within various spectral channels come from overlapping layers 
of the atmosphere and are not vertically independent of each other, and 
c. 
Measurements of outgoing radiance possess errors. 
As a consequence, there are a large number of analytical approaches to the profile retrieval 
problem. The approaches differ both in the procedure for solving the set of spectrally 
independent radiative transfer equations (e.g. matrix inversion, numerical iteration) and in the 
type of ancillary data used to constrain the solution to insure a meteorologically meaningful 
result (e.g. use of atmospheric covariance statistics, use of an a priori estimate of the profile 
structure). Various methods of sounding retrievals have been reviewed by Fleming and 
Smith, 1971; Fritz et al., 1972; Rodgers, 1976; Twomey, 1977; and Houghton et al. 1984. 
Following sections describe the mathematical basis for two-step procedure, which will be 
used in the development of retrieval algorithm for atmospheric profiles from INSAT-3D 
Sounder measurements.

16.4.2.1 Fast Forward Radiative Transfer Model: 
Remote sensing of atmospheric profiles from satellite is critically dependent on our ability to 
calculate observed radiances as a function of the atmospheric state. This forward problem 
is the heart of the physically based retrieval algorithms. The high rate of satellite 
observations requires a forward model fast enough to keep pace with the observations. 
Though line-by-line models exist to accurately compute atmospheric transmittances, they are 
far too slow to be practical. Thus fast atmospheric transmittance models are required for 
operational atmospheric sounding using physical methods. For INSAT-3D Sounder channels 
we use Pressure Layer Optical Depth (PLOD) model, also known as pressure layer fast 
algorithm for atmospheric transmittances (PFAAST), developed by Hanon et al (1996). This 
model has been widely used for profiles retrieval algorithm for GOES, NOAA-
TOVS/ATOVS, Aqua-AIRS/MODIS, etc (Li et al. 2000; Li et al. 2001 etc, Ma et al. 1999). 
The radiance recorded by the satellite sensor is the convolution of incident spectral radiance 
function with instruments spectral response function (SRF). Computing simulated radiances 
by calculating the monochromatic radiances and then convolving it with the instruments 
SRF takes too much time to be practical. In fast model PLOD a polychromatic approximation 
for the transmittances is made which directly computes the approximate convolved radiances. 
The monochromatic radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere, excluding scattering and 
reflection, is given by

temperature T(i) and z(i) is layer-to-space transmittance from layer i to space. s is surface 
emissivity and T(s) is surface temperature. Applying the polychromatic approximation, we 
convolve the layer-to-space transmittances and compute the radiances using above equation 
instead of convolving the monochromatic radiances. PLOD model relates the convolved 
layer-to-space transmittances to a simple function involving various profile dependent 
predictors. These predictors are functions of layer pressure, temperature, absorber amount, 
and viewing angle. Convolved transmittance is given by:

eff is the effective layer transmittance, Qi is the profile dependent predictor, and ci are the 
fast transmittance coefficients determined by linear regression of the above equation for a set 
of representative atmospheric profiles. PLOD model uses a regression on ln(), i.e. the 
optical depth (k). 
A set of profiles is selected for calculation of the layer-to-space transmittances, which is used 
for regression in fast coefficient computation. These profiles represent the entire range of 
atmospheric variation, and should be weighted towards more typical cases. Computation of 
convolved layer-to-space transmittances is time consuming, thereby restricting the practical 
limit of number of profiles to be used in the regression. We use 49 regression profiles (6 
zenith angles upto 62.5), which cover most of profile behavior in the INSAT-3D viewing 
region.

All profiles should cover necessary vertical levels for temperature and absorbing gases. 
Among absorbing gases only water vapor and ozone are allowed to vary in mixing ratio, and 
other gases are held fixed. Fixed gases include all those whose spatial and temporal 
variations have a negligible impact on the observed radiances. Monochromatic layer-to-space 
transmittances computed for fixed and different absorbing gases at different zenith angles are 
convolved with the instrument SRF. For each layer the effective layer optical depths (kfixed, 
kwater, kozone) are obtained for fixed and variable absorbing gases. These effective layer optical 
depths are used in a regression analysis to compute the fast transmittance coefficients (ci). 
Choosing the set of predictors for accurate results is mainly a matter of trial and error. PLOD 
model uses 8 predictors for fixed gases (kfixed), 13 for water vapor (kwater), and 9 for ozone 
(kozone). These predictors are functions of temperature, water vapor, ozone profiles and sensor 
viewing angle, and are summarized as follows:

16.4.2.2 Cloud detection: 
Since atmospheric profiles can be retrieved only over cloud free observations, it is 
essential to detect the cloudy pixels. For each sounder pixel, a cloud detection algorithm 
is to be applied to get the clear/cloudy index. Various cloud-detection schemes are 
developed and implemented for infrared sounders (Smith et al. 1979; McMillen and Dean 
1982; Hayden 1988). Each pixel undergoes several tests for clear/cloudy identifications: 
 During daytime if visible channel#19 count is greater then a threshold, then the 
pixel is considered cloudy. 
 If longwave window channel (channel#8, 11.0m) brightness temperature is too 
cold (< 250) then the pixel is classified cloudy. 
 If the longwave window brightness temperature is 4 K cooler than that of the 
warmest pixel from 8 adjacent pixels, then this pixel is classified as cloudy. 
 Different window channels (thermal IR channels 8 and mid IR window channels 
17, 18) have different transparency. After atmospheric correction to each 
channel, few checks are applied to classify the pixel as clear/cloudy. During 
daytime very high difference in channel 8 and 18 brightness temperature 
indicates presence of clouds. Thresholds for differences in different channels 
brightness temperature are to be determined by RT simulations. 
Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

257
 Sounder channel brightness temperatures are simulated for each pixel using 
numerical model forecast profiles. If difference between simulated and observed 
sounder brightness temperature for cloud sensitive channels (3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14, 
15) is large (threshold decided by the forward model error and forecast error), 
then this pixel is classified as cloudy. 
If there are at least 9 clear pixels in the field-of-regard (FOR) comprised of 5 x 5 
pixels (or 4 clear pixels in the FOR comprised of 3 x 3 pixels), then the average of all 
pixels brightness temperatures for this FOR is used for clear-sky retrieval. This 
averaging reduces the random noise of measurements over individual pixels. 

16.4.2.3 Regression Retrieval: 
A computationally efficient method for determining temperature and moisture profiles 
from satellite sounding measurements uses previously determined statistical relationships 
between observed (or modeled) radiances and the corresponding atmospheric profiles. 
This method is often used to generate a first-guess for a physical retrieval algorithm, as is 
done in the International TOVS Processing Package (ITPP, Smith et al., 1993) and 
International ATOVS Processing Package (IAPP, Li et al, 2000). The statistical 
regression algorithm for atmospheric temperature is described in detail in Smith et. al. 
(1970). 
Regression coefficients are required to correlate observed radiances with vertical profile 
vectors. This derivation of regression coefficients in turn requires generation of training 
dataset from radiosonde profiles of temperature, humidity, ozone profiles, surface 
pressure representing the entire variations. Training dataset generated by CIMSS/SSEC, 
University of Wisconsin is used, which contains more then 12000 profiles. To include 
more local data into the training dataset and to create a testing dataset, radiosonde data 
over INSAT-3D viewing region is collocated and quality checked. These are total 
~40,000 profiles spanning over 2 years, twice daily observations. Surface emissivities at 
each sounder channel wavelength for all profiles are assigned from the global emissivity 
dataset generated by Seeman et al. (2006) at CIMSS. Sounder radiances/brightness 
temperature will be simulated using fast radiative transfer model (PLOD) and suitable 
instrument noise will be added to the simulated radiances. Regression coefficients 
between atmospheric profile vector, X (T-, q-, O3-profiles, Ts), with Sounder 
observations, Y (brightness temperatures) are computed at different zenith angles from 
simulated training dataset using: 
RC = dX.dYT.(dY.dYT)-1 --------- (10) 
Where, dX = X - Xmean, and dY = Y - Ymean 
These regression coefficients can be used to retrieve the atmospheric profiles, X, using 
the following relation: 
X = Xmean + RC.(dYobs)T ---------- (11) 
Emissivity and surface pressure are also used as predictors along with the brightness 
temperature observations to improve the retrieval accuracy. Quadratic term of all 
brightness temperatures is used as predictors to account for the moisture non-linearity in 
the sounder observations. Separate regression coefficients are generated for land and 
Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder

258
sea for day and night conditions. Regression coefficients are generated for different 
local zenith angles from nadir to 62.5. 
If any one or more channels in sounder become unusable, then regression 
coefficients will be recomputed from remaining well-behaved channels and suitable 
modification will be done in regression retrieval routine. In absence of regression 
retrieval the first guess will be taken from the model forecast. 
Another way to generate profile vectors through regression is by using the matchup file 
that contains the time and space collocated satellite radiance measurements and 
radiosonde profiles used for generation of the regression coefficients. This may be 
attempted after the launch of satellite and when enough collocated data points have been 
generated to represent the profiles variability. The advantage of the regression retrieval 
using the theoretically computed regression coefficients over real observations is that it 
avoids errors due to space and time differences between satellite observation and 
radiosonde profile observation. Observed matchup data would be very useful for 
removing the bias error caused by the forward model calculations. 
16.4.2.4 Non-Linear Physical Retrieval 
Though statistical regression algorithm has the advantage of being computationally 
efficient, numerically stable, and simple, it does not account for the physical properties of 
the radiative transfer equation (RTE). Therefore, after computing atmospheric profiles 
from the regression technique and creating a hybrid first-guess combining with model 
forecast, a non-linear iterative physical algorithm (Li et al., 2000, Ma et at. 1999, Seeman 
at al. 2003) is applied to the RTE to improve the solution. 
For non-scattering atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiative transfer 
equation may be written as: Following derivation by Li et al (1994) the RTE may be 
written as linear perturbation form:

Physical retrieval involves minimization of the following cost function (Rodgers 1976): 
J(X)=[Ym Y(X)]T.E-1.[Ym Y(X)] + (X - X0)T.H-1.(X X0) --------- (16) 
Minimization uses the following non-linear Newtonian iteration: 
Xn+1 = Xn + J(Xn)-1.J(Xn) -------- (17) 
This gives the following non-linear iterative form (Eyre 1989): 
Xn+1 = X0 + (Kn
T E
-1 Kn + H)
-1. {Kn
T E
-1 [dYn
m + Kn (Xn X0)]} -------- (18) 
Where, X is the atmospheric profile to be retrieved, X0 is the initial state of the 
atmospheric profile or the first guess, Ym is the observed brightness temperature vector, E 
is the observation error covariance matrix that includes instrument noise and forward 
model error, H is the a priori matrix that constrains the solution, which can be first guess 
error covariance matrix or another type of matrix. Usually H=I, where is the smoothing 
factor. Therefore, 
Xn+1 = X0 + (Kn
T E
-1 Kn + nI)
-1. {Kn
T E
-1 [dYn
m + Kn (Xn X0)]} ------ (19) 
Smoothing factor is very important in the solution and very difficult to determine. If is 
too large then the solution is over-constrained and large biases could be created in the 
retrieval, while if is too small, the solution is less constrained, and possibly unstable. 
The value is dependent upon the observations, the observation error, and the first guess 
of the atmospheric profile, and often chosen empirically (Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 
1988). Often it is chosen empirically (Susskind 1984; Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988). 
Li at al. (2000) uses discrepancy principle (Li and Huang 1999) to determine and is 
changed in each iteration according to 
n+1 = qn.n ---------- (20) 
q is a factor for increasing or decreasing. q is obtained in each iteration by the following 
condition: 
q0 = 1; if ||F(Xn) Ym||2 < 2 then qn = 1.5 --------- (21a) 

 if ||F(Xn) Ym||2 > 2 then qn = 0.8 --------- (21b) 
Where, 2 = ek2, ek is the observation error of channel k which includes instrument 
error and forward model error. The q factor is found from empirical experience to ensure 
Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder

260
that the solution is stable from one iteration to the next. This factor would be required to 
tune-up carefully for the INSAT-3D Sounder channels. 
Since atmospheric variables correlate between different levels, only a limited number of 
variables are needed to explain the vertical structure of atmosphere (Smith and woolf 
1976). Thus it is computationally efficient to solve the iterative equation. This reduces 
the number of unknown expansion coefficients to the same order as the number of 
measured radiances: 

X = fivi = V.f, 
 i = 1, M 

--------- (22) 
Where, vi is the ith eigenvector, fi is the ith expansion coefficient, and M denotes the 
number of terms. V and f represent the eigenvector matrix and coefficient vector, 
respectively. These eigenvectors are derived from a statistical covariance matrix of a 
large profile set of temperature, moisture and ozone. 
Y = K.X = K.V.f =K
~
.f 

--------- (23) 
Corresponding iterative equation becomes, 
fn+1 = (K
~
n
T E
-1 K
~
n + nI)
-1. {K
~
n
T E
-1 [dYn
m + K
~
n fn)]} 
---------- (24) 
Thus the retrieval problem is reduced to finding a set of coefficients that may be used 
with eigenvectors to update the meteorological variables. Statistical analysis of the GOES 
radiance information content (similar to INSAT-3D Sounder) reveals that five 
temperature and three water vapor eigenvectors explain all the variance in the sounder 
channels occurring above the instrument noise level (Ma et al 1999). Therefore, the 
physical retrieval problem has been reduced to one of solving for ten unknowns (five 
temperature eigenvector coefficients, three water vapor eigenvector coefficients, one 
ozone eigenvector coefficient, plus surface skin temperature perturbation) from 18 
INSAT Sounder observations plus two surface observations: surface air temperature and 
humidity. In absence of the surface observations only sounder observations will be used 
for observation vector. 
At each iterative step in the physical retrieval procedure, convergence tests are carried out 
for the quality control of the profile retrievals. Following two convergence tests are 
carried out at each iteration and if one of the test fails, then the retrieval is rejected. 
(i) The expansion coefficient convergence test defines the coefficient distance, dn+1 
defined by: 
dn+1 = (fn+1 - fn)T.( K
~
nTE-1K
~
n + nI)-1 (fn+1 - fn) 

------- (25) 
This should approach zero as the solution converges. At each iteration, the norm of 
the coefficient distance d is calculated and compared with previous iteration. If dn+1 
is smaller or equal to dn then iteration continues, else n is increased, and dn+1 is 
recalculated for the nth iteration. This procedure of changing continues until the 
norm of dn+1 is less then or equal to the norm of dn, and the iteration further 
continues towards convergence until the difference between the norm of dn+1 and 
the norm of dn is less than an experimental threshold (~0.1). If the norm of dn+1 less 
than or equal to the norm of dn is not met by the third increase in n, the retrieval

process is considered to be non-convergent and physical retrieval is assumed to be 
failed. 
(ii) Second convergence criteria is based on the brightness temperature residual test. 
The rms residual is defined by: 
(rn+1)2 = [Ykm Yk(Xn+1)]2/nch; 

------- (26) 
Where k is channel number, nch is total channel used in the iterative procedure. If 
rn+1 rn the iteration continue until rn+1 is acceptably small (less then instrument 
noise). 
Ancillary surface information is used as boundary condition for the profile solutions. The 
surface air temperature and humidity are treated as additional channels to assist the 
better retrieval of near surface atmospheric parameters. These surface observations may 
be within 30 minutes in time and 50 km in space of sounding time/location. Following

Validation 
Extensive validation campaign is required during the first six months of the satellite 
launch. Radiosonde profiles collocated with satellite observations will be generated over 
clear-sky conditions for different regions representing entire variability in atmospheric 
profiles. These collocated observations will also be used to correct the biases in the 
forward model, and then incorporated in the regression and physical retrieval routines for 
accurate retrievals and convergence.

16.6.1 Radiance bias removal 
Atmospheric profile retrieval is based on modifying the surface temperature and 
atmospheric temperature/moisture profiles in a manner such that brightness temperatures 
calculated agree with those observed from the satellite, within some uncertainty estimate, 
for the sounding spectral bands. 
For INSAT-3D Sounder we begin with a first guess profile, which is a weighted linear 
combination of profiles obtained from regression retrieval and NWP model forecast, 
interpolated in time and space to the location of the satellite measurement. The difference 
between the observation and the "forward calculation" from the first-guess profile 
represents the information available in the observation. 
However, in practice there are generally bias errors associated with the comparison of 
observation and the forward calculation. These may be due to calibration error, 
uncertainties in the filter functions, or imprecision in the transmittance model used in the 
forward calculation. Consequently, prior to calculating retrieval, bias error for each band 
is subtracted from the observation. Estimates of the bias error are obtained by examining 
ensembles of collocated observations and forward calculations where the atmospheric 
state is well known (i.e. in the vicinity of radiosondes). 

16.6.2 Data Required

with radiosonde observations 
NOAA, EUMETSAT 
Space and time collocated (within 100 km in space and 3 hours in time) profiles of 
temperature, humidity and ozone may also be obtained from the various other satellite 
missions, such as Aqua-AIRS/MODIS/AMSU, Metop-IASI, NOAA-ATOVS/AMSU, etc 
for the purpose of inter-comparison. 

16.6.3 Methods of Validation 
From the observed collocated profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone for clear sky 
conditions, brightness temperatures corresponding to Sounder channels will be computed 
with the help of fast radiative transfer model used in the physical retrieval routine. The 
computed brightness temperatures are analysed with Sounder-observed brightness 
temperatures to estimate the bias (slope and intercept of the linear regression equation) 
for each of the sounder channels. These bias-corrections will be implemented in the 
regression and physical retrieval routines to remove the bias between sounder 
observations and fast RT model computations. 
For clear sky conditions the observed profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone will be 
interpolated at the pressure levels of retrieval output (standard 40 pressure levels) and 
root mean square errors (rmse) from space and time collocated retrieved profiles will be 
computed at each vertical pressure levels. Separate statistics may be generated for 
retrievals over land and ocean.

16.7 
Technical Issues 
Final accuracy of the retrieved profiles will largely depend upon the accuracy of the fast 
radiative transfer model used in the retrieval procedure. Therefore, fast radiative transfer 
model needs to be properly validated and the forward model errors should be within 
instrument noise level. 
Ancillary data improves the quality of sounding retrieval near surface. However, 
such observations are very few over Indian region (INSAT-3D viewing region), 
therefore, the network of the automatic weather stations (AWS) needs to be 
strengthened. 
IMD has a network of radiosonde observations over India; however, for INSAT-3D 
validation and bias removal procedure highly accurate profiles are required. Therefore, 
for a limited period of time (6 months after launch), high quality radiosonde (Vaisala) 
observations should be available over land as well as ocean (special ship cruises) under 
clear sky conditions. 
Currently, ozone information is available only from single channel in Sounder, 
therefore, retrieval of ozone profile may not be very accurate and column integrated 
ozone will be more reliable product. 
16.8 
Future Scope 
With the advancement in the spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric gases it is 
possible to make improvement in the radiative transfer model. Improved fast radiative 
transfer models may be coupled with the physical retrieval routine in future, as and when 
available. Improvements will also be attempted by incorporating improved training 
dataset in regression retrieval. 
Another area for future development is improvement of cloud detection algorithm. This 
may include synergy of high-resolution Imager data with Sounder observations to detect 
sub-pixel level cloud contamination. 
 Initially, the retrieval will be attempted only over cloud-free FOVs. In future, an 
algorithm will be developed and implemented with retrieval routine to compute the 
cloud-cleared radiances over partially cloudy pixels. 
Retrieval of profiles in overcast conditions (valid above cloud top) will also be attempted 
in near future. 
This algorithm will also be useful for future hyper-spectral missions with suitable 
modifications.

Annexure-1 

Instrument Characteristics: 
INSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection 
during daytime. Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise 
sensitivity are summarized in the table-1. 
A flat elliptical scan mirror mounted at 45 to the optical axis intercepts the radiation and 
reflects it on to 310mm reflective telescope. At the telescope, dichroic beam splitters 
separate the visible spectrum and three IR coarse bands. The three IR bands then pass 
through the concentric ring of a cold filter wheel maintained at a low temperature (-
230C) to limit the background radiation. Channel filters on the filter wheel provide 
sequential sampling of defined narrow band spectral channels. There are three concentric 
rings on the filter wheel, each catering to a coarse band. Each of the rings is further 
divided in to a number of sectors each housing filter for a channel. Detector arrays for 
each coarse band consist of four elements arranged in north-south direction. Thus the 
combined IFOV of the arrays is 280 (E-W) x 1120 (N-S) R2. The IR detectors are 
mounted inside the radiant cooler and cooled to cryogenic temperature of less than 100K 
for improving noise performance detectors. The temperature of the detectors is 
maintained at fixed value using temperature sensors and heaters in a servo-loop. 
The scan mirror operates in step and dwell mode to facilitate sequential sounding. The 
east-west step size of scan mirror will be 280R (10km). At each step, the mirror dwells 
for 0.1 second to allow completion of full spectral coverage through filter wheel drive. 
After completing acquiring data in all bands, the mirror steps in north south direction by 
1120 R (40 km). The rotation of the filter wheel is synchronized to the mirror stepping 
so that the mirror remains stationary during the sounding. To optimize efficiency, both 
forward and reverse scans are used for data collection. In addition to full earth disc 
coverage, flexible programme modes are provided to cater to different coverage 
requirements based on dynamics of atmospheric environment. The scan mirror traverses 
to the space-look position to get cold reference for the IR detectors. The interval between 
two space-looks is of the order of one minute. The space-look periodicity is decided 
based on the estimate of the interval required for maintaining stable background and 
temperature of the IR detector so that the space-look data remains valid during this 
period. It is proposed to have a provision within the scan mechanism to accept motion 
compensation signal from AOCS to compensate for the various spacecraft rates, orbit 
perturbations and effect of the imager mirror slew on the spacecraft. Four detectors per 
coarse band in north-south direction will generate four soundings per channel for every 
step and dwell interval of 0.1 second through a complete rotation of the filter-wheel. Thus 
there are a total of sixteen detectors in the instrument, twelve for IR sounding channels 
and four for visible channel. 
The normal mode of Sounder operation covers 6000km x 6000km field of view and takes 
approximately 160 minutes. In addition, the instrument is designed with flexible modes 
of operation for fast and repetitive coverage. 
The cold space view is used for signal referencing and as a calibration point for all bands. 
In-orbit multipoint calibration of the IR channel is carried out through viewing of full

aperture high emissivity internal cavity, whose physical temperature is accurately 
monitored at multiple locations and transmitted in Sounder data stream. 

The detector outputs are individually amplified, integrated in synchronism with the filter 
wheel movement and digitized to twelve bits by A/D converter. The digitized data along 
with house keeping and calibration information is formatted, randomized and sent to 
transmitter as a serial data stream. The data rate is approximately 40 Kbps. 
The temperature control of the IR detector mounted on cooled patch as well as that of 
filter wheel will be achieved through proportional controller.

17.2.1 Overview and background 
Fog is disastrous weather phenomenon especially in terms of traffic safety and air quality. 
The spatial extend and dynamics cannot be adequately nowcasted using conventional 
ground measurements (Jacobs et al, 2003). However, the upcoming INSAT-3D data with 
improved spatial and temporal resolution can be used for near real time detection and 
mapping of fog. 
The detection of fog/low stratus with satellite data has been taken up since many years 
(Bendix 2002. The general methodology of fog detection involves identification of some 
threshold radiances or brightness temperature at different wavelengths. Fog is formed 
when vapor in the lower atmosphere condensed in cold conditions. The fog droplets are 
much smaller than the cloud droplet. The presence of these droplets affects the 
atmospheric visibility. The radiation difference between the cloud and fog is due to the 
spectral response differences of every channel. This provides the basis of fog detection.

17.4.1 Overview 

17.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 

Night Time Fog Detection 
The difference of brightness temperature corresponding to two spectral channels (3.9 and 
10.8m) is used for the identification of fog. The theoretical basis for the detection of fog 
using 3.9m and ~11 m channels rely on the particular emissivity properties for fog 
droplets (Bendix and Bechmann, 1991) in these two channels. The small droplets found 
in fog are less emissive at 3.9 m than at ~11m whereas emissivities are roughly same 
for larger droplets (Hunt, 1973) in both the channels. The difference between brightness 
temperatures measured at different wavelength is tested against a threshold value and 
attributed to the categories of clear/ fog/other clouds etc.. The difference in brightness 
temperature values below 0.5 K is assumed to be cloud free and above 2.5 K is 
represented as opaque clouds (Ellord, 1995). However, a threshold of 5.5 K to 7.0 K has 
been observed for fog developed over the Indo Gangetic plains of India (Chaurasia et al, 
2011) ranging from thin to thick fog case using MODIS data. This threshold will change 
with spatial and spectral resolution of the satellite data used for the detection of fog. 
Apart from this it also varies from time to time as well as from place to place and types of 
fog.

Day Time Fog Detection 
The basis of the algorithm is a gross cloud check. This test is based on the assumption 
that the brightness temperature of high clouds are very low (<270 0K) and the brightness 
temperature of fog lies between that of land (very high brightness temperature) and high 
clouds during day time. The high cloud regions are eliminated by using a threshold of brightness temperature of 10.8 m channel. This threshold is determined dynamically.

Once the region is classified as foggy, the day time detection algorithm is used. The day 
time algorithm of fog detection is based on the temporal differencing technique (Paul 
dEntremont and Gustafson, 2003) which is used operationally to monitor cloud using 
geostationary data. In this method apart from using thermal channel like TIR1 channel of 
INSAT-3D for cloud detection, the visible channel (0.55-0.75 m) is also used. The 
droplet size of fog being close to the wavelength of visible and infrared radiation, fog has 
prominent scattering effect. Thus the visible channel plays an important role in detecting 
day time fog.

1. A direct comparison with the fog product of MODIS at different acquisition time 
over the Indian region. 
2. The aerosol optical depth map generated by MODIS and INSAT-3D will be used 
to validate the presence of highly opaque aerosols as aerosols are also factor 
influencing fog formation in the Indo-Gangetic plain. 
3. The Kalpana visible data and FCC of CCD data at early morning hour can also be 
used to indicate the presence of fog in the previous night as fog is the deepest 
before sunrise. 

Validation through ground truth 
As visibility is one of the important criteria for fog identification the observation from 
station data (where ever available) can also be used as in-situ observation to validate the 
fog product. These station data may be available with Airport Meteorological Office 
(AMO) and India Meteorological Department over different locations. 

17.7 Technical issues 
Accuracy of the product will depend on the accuracy of the input radiance. Extensive 
research and development work is required especially for day time fog detection with the 
help of radiative transfer model simulations. One has to get various fog/low stratus 
optical properties such as droplet radius etc., perform radiative transfer model simulations 
at various solar zenith angles, types of atmosphere to arrive at detection algorithms. 

17.8 Future Scope 
Apart from techniques using visible and thermal channels for the detection of fog, 
methods to use hyperspectral and multispectral data is required to be developed and 
implemented.

Introduction 
18.2.1 Importance of Land surface temperature and its retrieval 
Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the land surface 
processes and climate studies on global and regional scales. It is needed as an input to a 
variety of climatic, ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical studies. Retrieval of 
LST from the Earth observation satellite is quite challenging since the land surface is 
laterally inhomogeneous and is composed of various materials with different geometries. 
Surface temperatures are derived from satellite based measurements in the thermal 
infrared (TIR) window channels using either empirical method or physical algorithm. 
A number of Earth observation satellites such as EOS-MODIS, ASTER, AATSR, 
NOAA-AVHRR, Landsat ETM+, GOES-8, GOES-R, MSG-SEVIRI etc have TIR 
channels to derive LST. Various algorithms and coefficients have been developed for 
LST retrieval for these systems and reported in the literature over a period of time 
(Ulivieri et al., 1994, Wan and Dozier, 1996, Sobrino et al., 2000, Sun and Pinker, 2003, 
Sobrino et al., 2004, Kerr et al., 2004, Sria and Sobrino, 2007, Sun and Pinker, 2007, 
Yu et al., 2009). 
Indian Earth observation satellites such as INSAT-2E, Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A and 
INSAT-3D have also TIR channels for surface temperature retrieval purpose. However, 
little attention has been paid to develop the method for estimating LST from Indian 
sensors. A Single Channel (SC) algorithm for retrieving LST from the thermal channel 
(10.5-12.5 m) of Kalpana-1 (K1) VHRR sensor was developed over India using a 
radiative transfer model (Pandya et al., 2010, Pandya et al., 2013). In order to exploit the 
presence of two TIR channels in the INSAT-3D Imager sensor for better estimation of 
LST, a study has been taken up to develop a method to retrieve LST through a split-
window (SW) algorithm. 
Objective of the present work is to develop an algorithm to retrieve LST using two TIR 
channels of the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D satellite using a radiative transfer (RT) 
model over India. Study also presents the comparison of INSAT-3D LST to the 
contemporaneous LST products available from the MODIS and K1 satellites.

18.2.2 Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D 
INSAT-3D is the new generation Indian Earth observation satellite launched by ISRO on 
July 26, 2013. It provides enhanced observations of land, ocean and atmosphere through 
two payloads namely Imager and Sounder from the geostationary orbit. The Imager 
payload is designed to sense solar-reflected and radiant energy from the Earth through six 
channels covering visible (VIS: 0.55-0.75 m), shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1.55-1.70 
m), middle infrared (MIR: 3.8-4.0 m), water vapor infrared (WVIR: 6.5-7.1 m) and 
thermal infrared (TIR1: 10.3-11.3 m and TIR2: 11.5-12.5 m) spectral regions of 
electromagnetic spectrum having varying spatial resolution ranging from 1 km to 8 km 
(CDR, 2009). Nominal specifications of spectral and spatial details of the Imager payload 
are provided in table 1.

1 shows the spectral response functions of TIR channels of INSAT-3D Imager. The 
INSAT-3D satellite views the Earths globe from its location of 84 degree East on the 
equator. The view zenith angle for INSAT-3D satellite from this particular location was 
computed by the method developed by Pandya & Dadhwal (1999) and its pattern over 
India and surroundings is shown in the figure 2.

To derive LST from various satellite-based sensors several types of split-window (SW) 
algorithms have been developed during past three decades; however, SW algorithm for 
Indian sensor has not been attempted. This document presents a theoretical base study 
that was carried out to develop a SW algorithm for LST retrieval using TIR observations 
from the INSAT-3D Imager. 
18.3 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 

Thermal infrared signal received by satellite sensors is combination of three parameters, 
namely; (1) surface temperature and surface emissivity, (2) atmospheric emission, 
absorption and scattering acting upon thermal radiation from the surface, and (3) the solar 
radiation during daytime. In the absence of atmosphere, estimation of LST of the Earths 
surface would be much simpler task. On the other hand, the presence of Earths 
atmosphere between the satellite and the surface changes the surface emitted radiances 
measured by the satellite sensor in several ways, making LST retrieval from satellite 
based platform a complex task (Dash et al. 2002). 
The transmission of the surface emitted radiance through the atmosphere to the satellite, 
and its interaction with the active elements of the atmosphere is expressed as Radiative 
Transfer Equation (RTE) (Dash et al. 2002). 

Where,

 = the at-sensor brightness temperature (K) 
 = the surface emissivity 
 = Planck radiance at surface temperature 

 = atmospheric transmittance 
 = upwelling path radiance 
 = downwelling sky radiance at Earths surface 

The first term stands for the surface-emitted radiance after being attenuated by the 
atmosphere, second term corresponds to the upwelling sky radiance emitted by the 
atmosphere towards the sensor, and last term represents the downwelling radiation 
reaching the sensor after being reflected from the Earths surface. Here all the quantities 
refer to a spectral integration over the bandwidth of channel i and depend on the view 
zenith angle. 
The Planck radiance Bi(Ts) is expressed as,

with c1 and c2 being the Plancks radiation constants, with values of 1.19104.108 
W.m4.m-2.sr-1 and 14387.7 m.K, respectively. 

Inverting Eq. (1) we get, 

In this problem, the surface temperature is basically coupled with two factors: the surface 
emissivity and the atmospheric absorptions. Developing an LST algorithm means to find 
a solution of decoupling the emissivity and the atmospheric absorption effects from the 
satellite measured radiance. The surface temperature Ts can be obtained from Eq. 1 and 2 
by correcting the atmospheric and emissivity effects and then by calculating Ts by 
inversion of the Plancks law. However, atmospheric correction of TIR radiances is the 
most difficult part (Liang, 2004). The use of SW algorithm avoids the atmospheric 
correction issue. This method uses two thermal bands typically located in the atmospheric 
window between 10.5-12.5 m. The basis of the technique is that the radiance attenuation 
for atmospheric absorption is proportional to the radiance difference of simultaneous 
measurements at two different wavelengths, each subject to different amounts of 
atmospheric absorption. Actually SW algorithm provides atmospheric correction of a 
brightness temperature measurement in one spectral band (typically cantered around 11 
m) given a brightness temperature measurement in a second spectrally-close band 
(typically cantered around 12 m) (figure 3). They exploit the differential absorption 
tendency of two neighbouring spectral bands due to various gases. To estimate LST from 
satellite observations, most SW algorithms are derived from a first-order Taylor-series 
linearization of the RT equation in long-wave infrared spectral bands (Yu, 2009).

The SW technique is particularly favoured for its simplicity and robustness. In most cases, 
the SW LST algorithms simultaneously convert brightness temperature to skin 
temperature, given the estimates of the surface spectral emissivity. A review of the SW 
technique and published SW algorithms can be found in Li et al., (2013). The SW 
algorithm selected and proposed for this study is given by (Li et al., 2013; Sobrino et al., 
1994) equation (4) and it is modified in the present study for varying view zenith angles 
for the Imager sensor (section 3.1),

Method and Data Used in the Study 

18.4.1 Methodology 
A flowchart depicting the steps followed in the proposed algorithm is shown in the figure 
4. The split-window algorithm requires a forward simulation study for generating split-
window coefficients through the RT model using various inputs (details discussed in the 
next sections). With the use of these split-window coefficients and emissivity information, 
the radiance observed at the top-of-atmosphere by the INSAT-3D Imager sensor is 
converted into the LST. The LST images generated from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor 
can then be compared with (a) K1-LST products available on MOSDAC archival system 
and (b) MODIS LST products available through the NASAs archival system. The 
individual components of this flowchart have been discussed in details in the following 
sub-sections.

Split-window method 
As discussed in the above section, the basis of SW technique is that the atmospheric 
attenuation suffered by the surface emitted radiance is proportional to the difference 
between at-sensor radiances measured simultaneously in two different thermal channels. 
Many types of the SW algorithms have been developed for the LST retrieval. In an earlier 
analysis reported in a paper (Pandya et al., 2011b), various SW algorithms were 
evaluated for LST retrieval from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Ten different published 
SW algorithms (or their slight variants) from the literature were evaluated and compared 
in the study and the following suitable form of algorithm (Eq. 3) was selected for the 
Imager sensor.

This SW expression was then modified from the original formulation for having 
improved results for correcting path length variation due to high view zenith angle 
imaging in the case of Imager sensor from the geostationary orbit as described in the 
following sub-section. 
18.4.1.2 
Modification of split-window method: Correcting for Path Angle 
Variability 
As shown in figure 2, the Imager sensor has wide field of view. McClain et al. (1985) 
first pointed out that, at high viewing angles, atmospheric absorption is amplified. 
Land surface temperature

Geometric analysis shows that the atmospheric path length at the sensors edge-of-scan 
(for view zenith angle ~65 degree) is at least 2.5 times higher than at nadir. Pandya et al. 
(2011a) have also shown that at-sensor radiance value observed by the Imager sensor 
reduces with increasing view zenith angle by an amount of 7 to 8 percent for 300 K target. 
This has a significant effect on the satellite measured brightness temperature. For a target 
on the ground having 300 K temperature and 0.98 emissivity with average atmospheric 
water vapor of 1.5 g/cm2, the at-sensor brightness temperature varies between 297.2 K to 
295.5 K for atmospheric path length changing from 1 to 2 corresponding to view zenith 
angle varying between 0 to 60 degree (figure 5). If a SW algorithms coefficients are 
determined for the nadir case, then use of same coefficients for all the view angles can 
significantly degrade the algorithm accuracy at large view angles. The standard MODIS 
algorithm addressed this problem (Wan & Dozier, 1996). Here, in the case of Imager 
sensor the view zenith angle can vary nominally up to 50 degree, so we intend to generate 
a unique set of split-window coefficients for each view angle sub-ranges (e.g., 00200, 
200300300350, 350400, 400450, 450500 and 500550).

18.4.2 Model used 
The satellite level signal in the TIR channels of Imager sensor was simulated using a RT 
model MODTRAN (MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANSmittance) 
version 4.0. The MODTRAN (Berk et al. 1999) was selected for the study because this 
model has been long publicly available and its heritage traces back to LOWTRAN 
(Kneizys et al. 1988). It is widely used and validated model for variety of remote sensing 
analysis and applications across the globe. It uses a more accurate and higher resolution 
molecular band model based on the Atlas of High Resolution Molecular Spectroscopic 
data (HITRAN) molecular database. With its spectral resolution capability of 2 cm1, this 
narrowband model can perform calculations very accurately with less input requirements 
as discussed by Lacis and Oinas (1991) and Liang (2004). They have shown that using 
two narrow spectral ranges of H2O and CO2 (for a resolution of 10 cm1, and for total gas 
pressures above 0.1 atm), the correlation accuracy can be improved to better than 1%. 
With its spectral resolution capability of cm-1 in frequency it simulates at-sensor radiance 
and transmittance as a function of: atmospheric inputs (model atmosphere, atmospheric

column parameters, aerosol model etc), surface inputs (emissivity, temperature), viewing 
geometry and information on spectral channels. 

18.4.3 Data used in the study 
Various data sets have been used in the present study for generation and validation of 
LST from the INSAT-3D Imager data. This includes the raw Imager data sets (at-sensor 
brightness temperature, latitude-longitude layers), MODIS emissivity products in two 
spectral channels, K1-LST products and MODIS-LST products. The K1-LST and 
MODIS-LST products were used for comparing the LST images being generated from 
the INSAT-3D Imager sensor using the proposed method. Table 2 summarizes the data 
sets used in the present study with their details.

18.4.4 Theoretical Simulations 
In the present study, we have simulated the at-sensor radiances by MODTRAN model in 
two TIR spectral channels (TIR1 and TIR2) of the Imager sensor by varying the 
following five parameters in the respective spectral regions of interest: (1) Temperature 
of the atmospheric lower boundary: The simulations for various atmospheric profiles 
over tropical region (SeeBor dataset) (Borbas et al. 2005; Seeman et al. 2008) are carried 
out with the boundary layer temperature ranging from approximately 260-320 K. (2) 
Atmospheric column water vapour: The water vapour values ranging from 0.1 g/cm2 to 
near saturated level have been used through each atmospheric profile. (3) Surface 
temperature: The land surface temperature ranging from 260-330 K has been taken 
keeping tropical region as the context. (4) View zenith angle (VZA): 0 to 60 degree. (5) 
Land surface emissivity: Emissivity values from the standard International Geosphere 
Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover types, major 10 major land cover types (ocean 
water, snow, sand, crop, shrubs, grass, forest, savanna, wetland, urban) have been 
considered from the MODTRAN database.

A set of radiosonde and satellite sounder profiles over tropical region from the SeeBor 
dataset (Borbas et al. 2005; Seeman et al. 2008) is selected for input in MODTRAN 
simulations. Figure 6 shows a graph of atmospheric profiles covering the boundary layer 
atmospheric temperature from 257.4 to 315.3 K and water vapour concentration from 0.1 
to 5 g/cm2 selected in the present study. Synthetic profiles were also generated from these 
basic profiles by modulating the surface temperature by 10 degree. The attenuation due 
to atmosphere has been considered because of uniformly mixed gases, namely, CO2, N2O, 
O3 and CH4 along with the water vapour in the MODTRAN forward simulations. The 
contribution due to solar radiation in the MIR channel is not considered in the simulations. 
All the transmittance and path radiance calculations were performed in the Imager 
thermal IR spectral channels by incorporating the spectral response function (figure 1) of 
the respective spectral channel.

Coefficients for SW algorithm are derived from simulation data generated with the RT 
model MODTRAN. Specifically, the relationship between the model input LST and 
output top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature is fit with an LST algorithm 
(equation 4) via regression to obtain the required coefficients.

Results 
18.5.1 Derivation of Split-Window Coefficients (SWC) 
The satellite-level signals in two TIR channels pertaining to Imager sensor were 
simulated for varying atmospheric and land surface properties discussed in the above 
sections. In order to determine the SWC a0 to a6 in Eq. (4), we divided the VZA into 
several tractable sub-ranges for improving the fitting accuracy and thus LST retrievals. 
Simulations were performed for VZA ranging from 0 to 60 degree taking into account the 
fact that the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D receives radiance from various VZA 
having varying atmospheric path length. The SW coefficients (a1 to a6) of Eq. (4) can be 
obtained through statistical regressions method for each VZA sub-range. Seven different 
sets of SWC were determined for each of this VZA sub-ranges, which are summarized in 
the table 3 and shown in the figure 8.

In these calculations LST was treated as free parameter and regression was performed 
systematically by taking into account the dependency of in the algorithm. The R2 values 
varied between 0.94 to 0.99 showing good correlation between modelled parameters in 
the split-window algorithm. 
18.5.2 Sensitivity analysis 
In order to provide an estimation of the theoretical error on the estimated LST, and also 
the contribution of the different terms to that error, a sensitivity analysis was performed 
based on the classical error theory using derivatives. Hence, the contribution to the error 
on the LST, e(LST) is given by the following terms:

where e refers to the error of the parameter considered in brackets. The different 
derivatives of the Ts given by Eq. (5) were calculated. Values of e(Ti)= e(Tj) = 0.1 K and 
e(i) = e(j) = 0.002 have been considered for the present study. These selected values 
are considered to be representative of typical errors when working in remote sensing. 

The results on the error and sensitivity analysis obtained for each view angle are 
summarized in table 4, which includes the contribution to the total error of the different 
terms (alg, NET, and ) and the total error in LST, e(LST). The errors on LST have 
been calculated by applying Eq. (5-7) to each of the thousands of simulated data points.

Generally, the accuracy of the SW algorithm is ensured by the standard error of the 
algorithm (alg). In this study, the alg values ranged between 0.68 to 1.52 K. An increase 
in the algorithm error was observed as view angle varied from lower to higher values. In 
terms of different contributions to e(LST), it is clearly seen that the less contribution is 
due to the uncertainty, with values ranging between 0.28 to 0.32 K. The NET ranged 
between 0.32 and 0.37 K. In terms of total errors on LST, e(LST), values ranged between 
0.82 K to 1.59 K, with an average error of 1.14 K. Looking at the analysis and results 
summarized in table 3, it is clear that the proposed SW algorithm performs best with 
overall error of 1 K when view angles vary between 0 to 35 degree. Since major of the 
Indian landmass is covered with the view angle up to 35 degree by the INSAT-3D 
Imager (figure 2), we expect to obtain overall modeling error less than 1 K. 
18.5.3 Application of LST algorithm to INSAT-3D Imager data 
A total of 40 raw images of INSAT-3D Imager sensor for every half an hour time period 
of 29th Nov. 2013 were obtained for the analysis. From the raw h5 images, the top-of-
atmosphere (TOA) radiance data corresponding to two split-window channels (TIR1 and 
TIR2) and latitude-longitude layers were extracted from it. The TOA radiance data were 
converted to the brightness temperature values using the calibration coefficients provided 
in form of look-up-table. Then these brightness temperature layers of two split-window 
channels were geo-referenced using the latitude and longitude datasets. An example of 
Imager standard false colour composite for a daytime (05:30 GMT) is shown in the figure 
9.

Figure 9. Image composite generated from INSAT-3D Imager data using the combination 
of TIR1, TIR1 and TIR2 channels for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) 

Now the TOA brightness temperature images corresponding to the split-window channels 
were converted into the LST values using the SWC and proposed method. Here a 
particular set of SWC was used in the SW algorithm depending upon a VZA sub-range, 
i.e. a unique set of SWC was applied for each of the seven VZA sub-ranges. Figure 10 
shows an example of LST image generated by the proposed method. The LST image 
shown here has been generated by the SW method along with the known emissivity 
values generated over India with the help of approximately 20 emissivity tiles of MODIS. 
The LST products have been generated with a typical spatial resolution of 4 km. A 
specific land-sea mask was applied to obtain only the landmass covered within the image. 
The cloudy pixels in the LST products are not masked out in the initial stage. The cloud 
masking was done in later part of the analysis based upon a bi-spectral thresholding 
method and an example of such LST image is shown in figure 11. To demonstrate the 
applicability of our SW method, all 40 images were converted to the LST and for detailed 
analysis and validation, three images were selected corresponding to daytime (05:30 and 
09:00 GMT) and night time (21:00 GMT) of 29th Nov. 2013 over India.

18.5.4 Generation of LST products on diurnal scale 
This section presents results on the generation of LST products on the diurnal scale over 
India and surrounding region. Examples of the 3D-LST images are shown in the figure 
12 for diurnal images acquired on Nov. 29, 2013. The 3D-LST images suggest that LST 
values were captured successfully, which ranged from 275-320 K over the Indian region 
for this particular day.

arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India as well 
as major portion of neighbouring countries having arid regions located in the west of 
India. While lower temperatures were observed in the northern parts of India, which are

were dominated by the winter crop regions. An analysis was carried out to obtain diurnal 
cycle of typical land covers in the LST profiles. The idea behind generation of LST on 
this scale is to check whether the model physics works well throughout the day or not. 
The diurnal patterns of LST over different land covers such as desert, shrub and crop are 
shown in the figure 13. The patterns resemble to the known behaviour of the LST on 
these land covers, which confirms that proposed SW method is working well over full 
day-night cycle.

Validation of Insat-3d Imager LST with K1/MODIS LST 
In order to check the performance of the proposed SW method, LST derived from the 
INSAT-3D Imager LST (3D-LST) with the SW algorithm was compared with (a) the 
Kalpana-1 VHRR (K1-LST) derived with the single channel algorithm and (b) MODIS 
LST (MOD-LST) derived with the SW method. Out of all the images, the comparison 
results obtained for three different times (05:30, 09:00, 21:00 GMT) corresponding to the 
MODIS satellite pass for a day 29th Nov. 2013 are presented in the following figures and

Above figures show the inter-comparison of 3D-LST with two other estimates, K1-LST 
and MOD-LST for three specific time of a day 29th Nov. 2013. The comparison of 
daytime and nighttime retrievals shows (figure 14, 17 and 20) that the LST values from 
3D fairly match with MODIS as well as K1 sensors. The comparison showed a good 
correlation having R2 values varying from 0.73 (05:30 GMT), 0.66 (09:00 GMT) and 
0.79 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. MODIS and from 0.81 (05:30 GMT), 0.80 (09:00 GMT) 
and 0.51 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. K1. While, the standard error of estimates (SEE) 
observed between 3D and MODIS were 1.84 K (05:30 GMT), 2.27K (09:00 GMT) and 
1.37 K (21:00 GMT). And the SEE observed between 3D and K1 were 1.24 K (05:30 
GMT), 1.37K (09:00 GMT) and 1.10 K (21:00 GMT). It is clear that nighttime retrievals 
showed an excellent match when the LST ranged between 280 to 300 (figure 21). 
However, for the daytime satellite-passes when temperatures were generally more than 
300 K in this part of the globe, 3D-LST showed a deviation as compared to the MOD-
LST (figure 15 and 18). In the case of satellite pass of 05:30 GMT, the 3D-LST 
demonstrated a moderate deviation with SEE=1.84 K (R2=0.73) as compared to the 
MOD-LST (figure 15). While 09:00 GMT satellite pass showed a slightly high degree of 
deviation (SEE=2.27 K, R2=0.66) (figure 18). 
Overall the 3D-LST values showed a good match with the reference LST values in the 
range of 270-310 K, demonstrating that the SW algorithm is working fairly well. 
However, for some of the daytime 3D-LST retrievals (e.g. 05:30 GMT), an unambiguous 
over estimation was observed as compared to MOD-LST retrievals. This overestimation 
in 3D-LST is apparent at all the LST values independent of low or high values in the 
daytime. Reasons of this overestimation in 3D LST could be: use of India-specific 
atmospheric profiles in present study for the RT modelling to obtain better tuning of the 
SW coefficients, difference in the algorithms used, difference in the spatial resolution, 
difference in time of data acquisition, ignorance of the reflectance term (3rd term of 
equation 1) in the simulation of at-sensor radiance. This reflectance term is quite small 
since it is multiplied with the downwelling radiance, atmospheric transmittivity and (1-
emissivity) components. But probably with the presence of solar radiation it may play an 
important role, which has to be checked in future analysis. Moreover, there are certain 
issues like cloud masking remain in the present LST retrieval. At many instances in the 
present analysis, thresholding method for cloud masking does not perform well especially 
over snow regions. A robust cloud-mask algorithm has to be devised and applied to get 
accurate LST products.

Conclusions 
This document presents results of a study to develop a method to generate LST product 
from the thermal infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager sensor over India using a RT 
model. A modified split-window algorithm including the view angle correction was 
developed specifically tuned for the Imager sensor. Simulations were carried out based 
upon a number of model inputs to derive a set of coefficients from the atmospheric 
functions particularly tuned for the Imager sensor. These SW coefficients were then used 
to generate the LST product. The total theoretical modelling error ranged from 0.8 K (for 
view zenith angle equal to 0 degree) to 1.6 K (for view zenith angle equal to 55 degree) 
with an average error of 1.1 K. The LST derived using the proposed method was 
validated with the Kalpana-1 VHRR LST and MODIS LST products for day and night

datasets. This inter-comparison brought out the fact that the proposed algorithm provided 
encouraging results with a very good match of 3D-LST with other reference LST 
estimates. The comparison of satellite derived LST with other two satellite observations 
over India showed a fairly good agreement between satellite estimates, with a R2 value 
up to 0.79 and RMSE of 1.37 K for 3D Vs. MODIS comparison, while a R2 value up to 
0.81 and RMSE of 1.1 K for 3D Vs. K1 comparison. The overestimation in the case of 
daytime observations in the 3D LST is to be explored in the future. A robust cloud 
removal algorithm has to be developed and applied on the LST images. The method 
developed in this report provides a theoretical base for generation of operational LST 
products over India from the INSAT-3D Imager data.

19.2 Introduction 
The process of evapotranspiration (ET) acts as one of the main drivers of the hydrological 
or water cycle. One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between 
the energy and water cycles. The potential ET rate (ETo) is influenced by several factors 
such as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among 
them, solar radiation is the most sensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% 
variability of ETo . The potential evapo-transpiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass 
reference evapo-transpiration (ETo), is expressed in terms of amount of water transferred 
per unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface covered with a uniformly 
and actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ETo represents the evaporative demand 
of the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply of moisture 
leads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable 
widely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input 
in soil water balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-
transpiration data to provide acceptable estimate of plants water requirements. This 
would provide regional water demand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural 
growing season. The combination of spatial rainfall with ETo would help in monitoring 
water deficit and surplus during a growing season for rainfed agriculture. 
Some contours of monthly climatic ETo have been generated by Department of 
Agricultural Meteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements 
of limited surface observatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will 
propagate large errors. No digital map of ETo is available to scientific community, 
modelers, resource managers and planners in India. Moreover, real-time updated spatial 
ETo product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales would aid in knowing the 
intra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors and their impact on 
deviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall and PET) is 
essential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations.

Therefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as 
crop forecasting. 
19.2.1 Overview and background 
The latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is 
significant in weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973; 
Rowntree, 1991; Anderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of evaporation has been 
known since approximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch), 
most of the understanding of the governing factors has been achieved in the last two 
centuries. Dalton (1802) was the first who proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit 
(esateact) of the near surface air to the evaporation rate. Later, many empirical 
relationships were developed based on other environmental factors (Blaney and Criddle, 
1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based on available energy considerations 
and turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his evaporation equation for natural 
surfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as potential evapotranspiration 
(PET). Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman equation in which 
biophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance the now well-known 
PenmanMonteith (P-M) combination equation that allowed for vegetation control on 
transpiration rates. 
Choudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as 
remotely sensed solar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and 
weather station measurements) and vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good 
evapo-transpiration estimates for low-resolution applications such as worldwide scale and 
monthly time step. The accuracy is limited by the high uncertainties provided by satellite-
sensed vapor pressure estimation. 
Later, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT 
observations from Heliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to 
estimate ETo using Hargreaves approach. The ETo can also be available as forecast bi-
product from weather forecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted 
radiative fluxes and operational short-range forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather 
elements from model for a limited winter months showed that the incident shortwave 
radiative flux produced the highest root mean square error to the tune of 110% 
(Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ measurements from 
INSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS). However, the 
errors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric 
pressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over 
plain and pleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to 
increase in the hilly terrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET0 would have 
substantial errors propagated mainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the 
other hand, the operational product on daily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced 
around 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) with respect to same ground reference 
and the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and 
monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud flagging and the spatial 
resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected to produce 
substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily 
insolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative

humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional 
product of potential evapo-transpiration. 
19.2.2 Objectives 
The objectives of this document are :

average operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution 
to generate product of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution 
(iii)To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) 
chain for automation of ETo product generation 
(iv) To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results 

19.2.3 Instrument and characteristics of input products 
19.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D) 
The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of 
Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological 
Department (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT 
system, which was launched at geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of 
four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR (1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and 
two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with nineteen sounder channel. The 
spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for MIR, 
WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data 
Processing System (IMDPS) provides both full-globe and sector data products in all 
the bands at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, 
there are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each 
acquisition were corrected for servo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling 
removal using the INSAT 3D data products scheduler. This results into automated 
generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection. 
The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 columns for Asia 
Mercator sector product. 
19.2.3.2 Operational insolation product 
A spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to 
determine integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-
hourly observations from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used 
to provide minimum ground brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 
days, cloud top albedo, brightness temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to 
these models in addition to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and 
columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to obtain daily insolation (in 
MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout the day for all-sky 
conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) will 
be operationalized and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution

19.2.3.3 Operational product of WRF short-range forecast 
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is 
used for All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, 
primitive equation model with multiple options for various physical parameterization 
schemes. This version employs Arakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a 
fully compressible system of equations. The terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-
ordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in vertical. The time-split integration 
uses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for acoustic and gravity wave 
modes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the WRF Single 
Moment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi 
ensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University 
(YSU) planetary boundary layer scheme. 
The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal 
resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260235, 
352373 and 676721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The 
model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The 
WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-
AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial conditions. The 
operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site 
used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and 
assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations 
(Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. 
EUMETCast). The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at 
three hourly interval upto 72 hours. 
Examples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast 
product of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over 
Indian region are shown in Figure 1.

19.4 Algorithm functional specifications 
In 1948, Penman combined the energy balance with the mass transfer and derived an 
equation to compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard 
meteorological records of sunshine, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This 
combination method was further extended to vegetated surface by introducing resistance 
term. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have been added to the original equation 
of Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) from a surface. This 
formulation is referred as FAO-56 Penman and Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) ETo for a 
day. This is treated as standardized model worldwide. This is described as follows:

The radiation striking perpendicular at the top of the earth's atmosphere called the solar

between the direction of Sun's rays and the normal to atmosphere. This angle will change 
within a day and with latitude on different days of the year. Solar radiation received at the 
top of the earth's atmosphere on a horizontal surface is called extraterrestrial (solar) 
radiation,

The longwave radiation emission is proportional to the absolute temperature of the 
surface raised to the fourth power as per Stefan-Boltzmann law. The net radiation leaving 
the earth's surface is however, less than emitted due to the absorption and downward 
radiation from the sky. The atmospheric constituents like water vapour, clouds, carbon 
dioxide and dust are absorbers and emitters of longwave radiation. Their concentration 
should be vital for assessing the net outgoing radiation. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is 
corrected for water vapour and cloudiness by assuming the concentration of other 
atmospheric constituents remain constant.

regions where the sun angle is significantly less than 50o so that the path length of

19.4.12 Steps for operational implementation 
The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of Potential 
evapo-transpiration product generation : 
i) Daily (24 hours) average meteorological data are to be carried out by averaging 3-
hourly forecast from WRF (ASCII format) at 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid for all the 
four variables 
ii) Maximum , minimum air temperatures and relative humidity need to be generated 
from 3-hourly forecasts in a given day 
iii) Conversion of all ASCII oouputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 
0.05o X0.05o grid resolution 
iv) Conversion of all INSAT 3D generated insolation ouput to raster of dimension 
approx. 0.05o X 0.05o grid resolution 
v) Repojection of operational daily insolation product present Transverse Mercator 
to geographic projection 
vi) Resampling of gridded insolation to WRF grid resolution followed by subsetting 
for India with same dimensions as that of WRF.

transition. Monthly ETo linearly increased throughout India from January to June and 
then decreased in monsoon during July and August. After that, gradual rise in September 
coincident to higher insolation due to with drawl of monsoon. The ETo again decreases in 
October and November but there is rise in western part of India during December due to 
increase in day length in last dekad of December.

19.7.1 Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting 
The sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using Sobol 
method. It consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent 
samples of N repetitions (rows) and k input variables (columns), retrieved from 
existing data or randomly generated data from the probability distribution function (PDF) 
of each k input variable. One or several variables in the first sample are substituted by 
the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each of the (2k - 1) possible 
combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, N runs of the model 
are computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called 
sensitivity or Sobol indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition 
of the total variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous 
variations of the k model inputs.

In oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest 
area (SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from 
November to February), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET0 values 
calculated using P-M method (e.g. 38% of ET0 total variance in January). Then come 
relative humidity and air temperature (32% and 17% of ET0 total variance in January, 
respectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air temperature and daily amplitude of 
relative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration process during winter. This 
trend changes during March and October. From April to September, ET0 is mostly 
sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in July). 
From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature 
and their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of 
ET0 variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to 
other variables variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during 
summer, and wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B). 
In Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation to climate input variables using 
P-M method in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a 
major impact on ET0 calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most 
influent variable during summer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the 
great sensitivity of this PenmanMonteith formula to solar radiation during summer 
period, when ET0 reaches its highest values, and when its calculation is critical for 
irrigation process and ecological modelling. These results were obtained for 
Mediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work published by 
Gong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to 
similar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET0 during 
winter than it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman
Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of 
satellite-sensed solar radiation to ET0 calculation.

19.7.1.1 Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements 
The daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available 
through MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the 
period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other 
routine inputs from WRF forecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, 
dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 estimates at regional scale following the steps 
mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based regional ETo estimates, the 
measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were used 
(Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables 
at 30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six 
sites over different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for 
different time period as listed in Table 6. The ETo was calculated on daily basis using 
AMS half-an-hour average measurements.

19.7.1.2 Validation results 
A. Daily scale 
Daily ETo estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ETo computed from 
AMS measurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot 
is shown in Figure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ETo 
computed from AMS varied from 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ETo varied 
from 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different seasons for selected stations. The error analysis 
showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) varied from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the 
tune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table 7). The overall pooled data 
set showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured mean. This was due 
to high fluctuation of ETo on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all six AMS 
stations. The estimated daily ETo showed underestimation as well as overestimation for 
all AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations.

The daily ETo fluctuation was high and leads to high deviation from measured AMS 
mean so data were summed for 10-days for further analysis. The 10-days cumulative 
estimated ETo was validated with cumulative ETo from AMS data. The temporal 10-day 
ETo over different stations are shown in Figure 7 for six selected stations and error 
statistics are given in Table 8. The dekadal change in estimated ETo matched well with 
AMS ETo. The seasonal change was also well captured in 10-day cumulative ETo. 
In Naraingarh, Punjab, the comparison was made for the period from January to April. In 
January and February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low 
radiation and temperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad. 
The rise and fall of computed ETo was well captured in estimated ETo during January to 
April. The RMSD was 9.3 mm which is 28.9% of AMS mean for the stated period. The 
1:1 scatter (Figure 8) showed a 91 % correlation.

The site in West Bengal represents lower gangetic plain of agro-climatic regions having 
moderate cold season of January and February to moderate hot season during March and 
April. During this period rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal 
temporal profile of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount 
of deviation during April. This may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop 
and was only captured in computed ETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. 
The temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 to 30 mm in January with gradual rise in 
February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due to rise in temperature and

radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the estimates. The 
overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with 
respect to AMS. 
The central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at 
Powarkheda site. The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall 
varies from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The 
estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal 
high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo always remained high as 
compared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After that, estimated 
ETo underestimated measured ETo. In January, both showed low values in the range of 
30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm 
(estimated) in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 
mm over ten days (16.6% deviation from AMS mean). 
The typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented 
here by Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and 
February. The data over monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for 
computation of ETo. In this part of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well 
captured by dekadal ETo variation during stated months. During July, ETo remained 
higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ETo 
showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to 
AMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD of 6.3 
mm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo. 
The southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural 
scrub vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used 
for comparison with AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well 
with AMS ETo. The difference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon 
season (January to February) but later on, the difference was reduced further in May and 
November. The data showed a RMSD of 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS 
mean). 
The island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions 
as compared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so 
climatic condition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and 
August to November were used for comparison. The AMS ETo on an average had a range 
of 23 to 50 mm throughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was 
observed for estimated ETo. The dekadal behaviour of estimated ETo matched well with 
AMS ETo but showed little higher deviation during August and September. It showed 
RMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean).

19.7.1.3 Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation 
The daily estimated and AMS ETo was compared for different time windows viz. 3-day, 
5-day, 7-day and 10-day. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured 
ETo gradually increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from 
daily to 7-day i.e from 8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation 
coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah 
(BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer (6.3%) as compared to LPSC 
(Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. Similarly per cent 
deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the deviation 
drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day 
except than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days 
as marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from 
daily to 7-days and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help 
us use this ETo data in various applications on different time scales with known errors.

19.7.1.4 Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere 
Considering the results of PenmanMonteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems 
reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial 
ETo as no regular spatial record are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) 
attempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o x 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation 
from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour 
pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS operational vertical sounder 
TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast retrieval assimilation 
system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with lysimeter data 
and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean. 
Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS 
equipped with humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using 
Potential evapotranspiration

331
FAO-56 P-M method. They used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by 
following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al. 2004). The study found that most of the 
errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to uncertainties in retrieving daily solar 
radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 1.32 mm (11% to 110% from 
daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of ETo mean value) at 
0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ETo mean 
value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational 
product of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05grid for estimation of 
ETo at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from 
measured mean) but it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and 
further in monthly scale (21% from monthly mean). The overall error at different 
temporal domain were found in good harmony with reported errors in other part of world. 
19.8 
Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues 
The following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of 
ETo estimates and its comparison with ground reference 
(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS 
The FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and 
radiation data from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct 
measurement of radiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in 
terms of standard energy units. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The 
sensitivity analysis of P-M method by Gong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) 
highlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were clearly the most influent variables 
for ETo estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data from AMS are used. But 
these measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. Since 
vegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS 
would definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates 
from integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables. 
(ii) Scale mismatch 
Spatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel 
area while the average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale 
mismatch puts constrain in validation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with 
INSAT 3D. 
(iii) Difference in time sampling 
For spatial ETo, daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at 
instantaneous snapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-
hourly averages from AMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets 
(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging 
The product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of 
approximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ETo estimates have 
higher errors during the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud 
dynamics such as Diglipur (A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc. 
Potential evapotranspiration 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

332
(v) Quality of WRF forecast 
An initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-
2C, RH of 5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. 
The inherent errors in first three variables will have implications on the overall error 
budget. 
19.9 
Future scope of improvement 
Recent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT 3D insolation 
algorithm using additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. 
Much of the uncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully 
be improved. 
Recent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed 
improvement in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of 
real-time satellite based other land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture 
would definitely help in improving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work 
should address the retrieval / estimation of those variables from Indian geostationary 
satellites. 
The INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. 
This would reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation.

Introduction 
The amount of solar radiation flux or irradiance in the shortwave (0.3 - 3 m) reaching at 
ground surface is known as surface or global insolation. It is composed of direct and 
diffuse components. While reaching the ground from top-of-atmosphere solar radiation 
is attenuated by different atmospheric constituents such as water vapour, ozone, aerosol, 
air molecule, clouds and fogs through scattering and absorption processes. The molecular 
scattering by air molecules is known as Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering is Mie 
scattering. The component of solar radiation that reaches earth surface without deviation 
from original direction is known as direct or beam insolation. The component of solar 
radiation reaching earth surface after scattering is known as diffuse insolation. Diffuse 
component is composed of three components such as : Rayleigh scattered, aerosol 
scattered and reflected multiple scattered insolation. Clouds play major role in attenuating 
solar radiation while reaching earth surface. It is accountable for 70% depletion of solar 
radiation depending on its type, distribution and ice-cloud proportioning of three-
dimensional vertical structure. Moreover, aerosol acts as cloud condensation nucleii 
(CCN). The contribution of clouds towards diurnal variability of insolation is more than 
aerosol and atmospheric gases specially during monsoon season. Fog also plays an 
important role in attenuating solar radiation in the winter. The interaction of solar 
radiation with atmospheric constituents and clouds is shown in Figure 1.

agents for its depletion in clear and cloudy skies 

Surface insolation is the driving input for eco-physiological processes such as 
evapotranspiration (Jacobs et al, 2000) and photosynthesis (Chen et al, 1999). The 
trapped energy through formation of ATP and NADPH in light reaction is utilized in 
the dark reaction of photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates. The photosynthetic 
response of plant species to different light intensity determines primary productivity, 
therefore, it is as critical component to assess bio-energy and bio-fuel resources. 
Insolation is the major contributor of earths radiation and energy budget. It is also a 
crucial input to crop simulation model for yield forecasting. 
In climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, use of renewable energy resources 
such as solar energy plays important role to maintain a emission-free green and safe 
environment. Monthly solar radiation maps on spatial scale are very important to locate 
solar energy conversion systems such as solar PV or thermal power plants (Janjai et al, 
2005). Conventionally, these maps are constructed from high density network of 
pyranometers. However, in India, a very sparse network of pyranometer stations is 
presently operating. Interpolation from such sparse network produces large errors (60-
70%) due to large uncertainties of intermittent diurnal cloud cover, cloud types and 
atmospheric turbidity in cloudless skies. Moreover, high maintenance costs and lack of 
availability of real-time data are major impediments. Several estimation models have 
been developed based on temperature amplitude, sunshine hours or cloud cover and

combination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, but these require site and season specific 
calibration coefficients and thus difficult to extrapolate. Moreover, such models do not 
explicitly consider the role of atmospheric constituents such as air molecule, aerosol, 
water vapour, ozone. The use of remote sensing observations from geostationary satellite 
sensors that have high temporal sampling frequency (multiple passes every day) are ideal 
to capture spatio-temporal variability of surface insolation for those regions where 
regular measurements from sparse radiation network and their availability are not 
consistent till date. 
20.2.1 Overview and background 
Broadly, two approaches such as (a) statistical or empirical (Tarpley, 1979; Noia et al, 
1993) and (b) physical or radiative transfer (Tanahashi et al, 2001) schemes are in use to 
estimate surface insolation using geostationary satellite data using broad visible band and 
thermal infrared bands. Empirical or statistical techniques for surface insolation include 
Heliosat (Dagestad, 2004), contrast ratio (Rosema et al, 2004) approaches applied to 
Meteosat. Heliosat model has been developed under Helioclim project of Europe and has 
undergone several revisions. It is based on deriving cloudiness index from maximum, 
minimum albedo in a time series and current albedo. This cloudiness index is converted 
into surface insolation through clearness index (ratio of surface insolation and insolation 
at-top-atmosphere) using pre-determined empirical relations. Physical modelling schemes 
of clear sky insolation are of two types: (i) top-down approach that corrects incoming 
solar irradiance (Pinker and Lazlo, 1992; Lu et al, 2010) for atmospheric attenuation 
(absorption and scattering) before reaching the surface (ii) bottom-up approach that 
determines surface albedo (Gautier et al, 1980) from planetary albedo by separating out 
atmospheric interferences and arrive at surface insolation through inversion. Several 
schemes are available to account for attenuation of solar radiation flux passing through 
clouds either using cloud top albedo or reflectivity that represents cloud backscatters or 
from combination of cloud-top albedo or temperature or cloud optical thickness and 
cloud-top pressure. Spectrally integrated irradiance model and three-layer cloudy scheme 
were implemented with Kalpana-1 VIS, WV and thermal IR bands to estimate 
instantaneous and daily insolation (Bhattacharya et al, 2012 and 2013). Statistical models 
are only based on visible band observations while physical model requires inputs from 
both visible and thermal bands in addition to determination of cloud mask. While the 
errors of statistical techniques varied from 1217% for daily total insolation (Kandirmaz 
et al, 2004), the physical approach produces error of about 19% on hourly basis and 
lesser for daily to monthly averaging. Moreover, the statistical models call for region-
specific updates of coefficients through ground datasets which are time consuming.

20.2.3 Instrument characteristics 
The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of 
Space (DOS) and India Meteorological Department (IMD). It provides half-an-hour 
observations from six channel Imager and 19-channel Sounder. The Imager has one 
broad VIS (0.55-0.75 m) band (1 km x 1 km), one SWIR (1.55 1.70 m) band (1km 
x 1km), one MIR (3.8 4.0 m) band (4 km x 4 km), one water vapour (6.5 - 7.1m) 
band (8 km x 8 km) and two split thermal (10.2 - 11.3 m, 11.5 - 12.5 m) bands (4 km 
x 4 km). The sounder has 19 channels to provide vertical profiles of atmospheric 
temperature and humidity. There are 22 geophysical products which are scheduled to 
be available from an operational processing known as INSAT Meteorological Data 
Processing System (IMDPS). This has been successfully implemented in Kalpana-1 
VHRR and INSAT 3A VHRR and CCD (Anonymous, 2005). This system provides 
both full-globe and sector data products. Presently, there are 40 acquisitions against 
a maximum of 48 acquisitions per day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition are 
corrected for servo, lineloss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using data 
products scheduler. These result into automated generation of co-registered data with 
fixed projection having fixed number of rows and columns. Examples of diurnal data 
product in VIS band from INSAT 3D over Asia Mercator are shown in Figure 2.

 20.4 Algorithm functional specifications 
The algorithm uses a clear-sky model with spectrally integrated radiative transfer scheme 
that requires solar zenith angle, elevation, slope, aspect of terrain, aerosol, water vapour 
and ozone as inputs. This accounts for depletion of instantaneous incoming solar 
radiation flux due to atmospheric perturbances or turbidity. In cloudy-sky, a separate 
three-layer scheme was implemented where cloud is assumed plane parallel sandwitched 
between upper and lower cloudless atmospheric layers.

Angstrom turbidity parameter to compute aerosol transmittance assuming Angstrom 
turbidity exponent parameter as 1.3 ( Iqbal 1983 ). The ozone data from MODIS was 
used to compute ozone transmittance. 
The monthly minimum ground brightness from previous thirty days VIS band planetary 
albedo 
 was dynamically determined for each acquisition and was used as 
surrogate for ground albedo 
 The planetary VIS band spectral albedo was corrected 
for Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering effect and cloud interferences on planetary 
albedo were assumed to be removed with monthly minimum composites understanding 
that surface properties have not changed significantly within thirty days. The multiple 
scattering component contributes little to total diffuse irradiance over vegetated region 
(albedo between 0.1 and 0.3) but is a dominant component over snow bound areas or 
desert ( > 0.3) with significantly higher albedo. 
20.4.1.3 
Global or total irradiance 
Both direct and diffuse irradiance are dependent on the zenith angle of the sun that 
changes from sunrise to sunset and on the orientation of the surface. On an arbitrarily 
inclined surface with slope, , and aspect, , at a given location on earth surface with 
latitude, , the angle 
 between the incident radiation and the normal to the surface is 
expressed as , 

 (12) 

 (13) 
 = solar declination angle (radian) 
h = sun hour angle (radian) 
Depending on the terrain properties and solar geometry, the surface may be in the shadow 
of nearby topographic features; 
is then assigned a value of zero that represents no 
direct irradiances. Diffuse radiation was assumed to be isotropic in distribution in the 
atmosphere, i.e. the sky is uniformly bright. Depending on the slope and nearby 
topography, only a fraction of hemisphere might be visible, which is referred as the sky-
view factor 
, which is time invariant and is dependent only on terrain parameters. 
The total 
or global irradiances (Wm-2) received on surface at any instance 
 is 
given by, 
 (14) 
The 
 is determined as the ratio of diffuse sky irradiance to that on an unobstructed 
surface. In present algorithm, this was computed using expression given by Kondratyev 
(1977).

20.4.2. Cloudy-sky model 
A three-layer scheme was conceptualized and implemented to compute irradiances in 
cloudy skies. The first layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere over cloud-top where 
direct and diffuse components were computed using algorithm mentioned in section 3.1. 
Molecular (above cloud) and aerosol scattering, gaseous transmission due to ozone were 
considered. Entire aerosol and ozone were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Both 
direct and diffuse components were computed and the sum of these two resulted into 
global irradiances without any sky-view factor. The second layer corresponds to plane 
parallel cloud. The vertical cloud structure and its three-dimensional effects on cloud 
transmission especially on diffuse component were not considered in the present model. 
The third layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere below cloud. Molecular scattering 
(air below cloud) was only considered in layer 3. The precipitable water was assumed 
entirely distributed below cloud and contributed to gaseous transmission along with other 
gases. 
In order to compute Rayleigh scattering above cloud, the height of cloud-top was 
approximated from cloud-top temperature, maximum clear-sky planetary temperature 
within previous 30 days, ground elevation and dry-adiabatic lapse rate up to condensation 
level represented through cloud-top temperature. Here also, direct, diffuse and global 
irradiances were computed using the principles used in the section 3.1. The irradiance 
coming out of first and top clear-sky layer after attenuation is considered as the incoming 
solar radiation flux cloud layer. The energy flux that comes out after being attenuated in 
cloud layer was considered as influx for third layer (clear-sky layer below cloud) which 
again gets attenuated to reach at the ground. The global irradiance received at the ground 
is considered as insolation in cloudy-sky. 
The transmission through cloud was computed using Kubelka-Munk theory. 

 (16) 
 This relates cloud-top albedo 
 with cloud transmittance (
. The coefficients 
 in the equation 16 vary according to different land use categories which were 
taken into account through typical ranges (< 0.2 for water bodies, forest; 0.21 to 0.32 for 
agriculture; >0.3 for desert and snow cover) of ground albedo represented by minimum 
ground brightness from previous thirty days. 
20.4.3 Daily integration 
A trapezoidal integration was applied to construct daily integral from diurnal 
instantaneous global irradiances. The daily integral global irradiance 
 was expressed in 
MJm-2. The mathematical expression for daily integration is:

20.4.4 Flow chart 
Figure 3 

20.4.5 Operational implementation 
Step 1: Unpacking and pre-processing 
First sub-program should unpack h5 (Hierarchical data format) datasets from INSAT 3D 
Imager, reads DEM and computes date, time, year from name of file string as well as 
sun-sensor zenith, azimuth angles. Brightness temperatures in IR and WV bands and VIS 
albedo (after removing perturbation due to molecular scattering) were also computed 
from look-up table (LUT) and calibration coefficients provided with h5 datasets. 
Step 2 : Generation of minimum ground brightness and maximum brightness 
temperatures for cloud-fog detection and cloud height determination 
This sub-program uses INSAT 3D Imager brightness temperatures and VIS band 
albedo or reflectance of a lead of previous 30 days. The maximum temperatures and 
minimum albedo were picked up for each pixel at a given acquisition. Both are used as 
bi-spectral thresholds to detect cloud. In addition, a cloudiness index is generated through 
normalization of VIS band TOA reflectance, its upper and lower limts. Both dynamic 
bispectral thresholds and threshold of cloudiness index ( > 0.15) are used to for cloud and 
fog detection and masking during daylight hours. Temperature composites and current 
acquisition temperature will be used to determine cloud height from dry-adiabatic-lapse-
rate (DALR) 
Step 4 : Interpolation of climatic gridded AOD550, ozone and resampling 
Another sub-program should use eight-day gridded (1 x 1) climatological aerosol 
optical depth (AOD) and ozone to extract from global products for the latitude and

longitude bounds of south-east Asia corresponding to K1VHRR Asia Mercator sector 
coverages. These can be resampled down to 8 km spatial resolution using bilinear 
interpolation and reprojected to INSAT 3D Imager projection. 
Step 4 : Generation of time series instantaneous insolation 
The main program should compute time series instantaneous global (direct + diffuse) 
insolation for a given acquisition using the outputs from other sub-programs, clear-sky 
and cloudy-sky models. 
Step 5 : Daily integration 
Another program should perform trapezoidal integration of both bias-uncorrected and 
bias-corrected instantaneous insolation at 23:30 hrs GMT on a given day. This program 
should fetch instantaneous insolation from different acquisitions on a given day and make 
a list. This program should first check at least one acquisition within two hours and then 
daily integration should be performed. It means that If at least well distributed five 
instantaneous insolation are available in the list, the integration is performed. 
The whole algorithm has been implemented with Kalpana-1 VHRR data from 2012 to 
generate operational products on insolation after the clearance by ATBD review 
committee set-up by Director, SAC and in-house T & E has also been carried out. 
The same algorithm was applied with INSAT 3D Imager data to estimate instantaneous 
insolation over limited datasets

The example of instantaneous surface insolation is shown in Figure 4. 

20.6 Sensitivity analysis for error budgeting 
The responses of clear-sky model on global, direct and diffuse instantaneous insolation, 
direct/diffuse ratio, diffuse fraction to variation in solar zenith angle, atmospheric ozone, 
water vapour and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm were studied. This was carried 
out with the observed seasonal range of AOD, water vapour and ozone over station 
Bijapur. The effects of change in aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) were studied 
at low (10-20) and high (40-70) levels of solar zenith angles (Figure 5a).

Figure 5a. Sensitivity of the clear-sky insolation model to aerosol optical depth 
There was substantial and similar trend of decrease in both global (15-20%) and direct 
(25-30%) instantaneous insolation for a given range of AOD500 (0.05 to 0.6), but the gap 
between direct and global is reduced at higher solar zenith angle. The steepness of slopes 
of direct insolation was more negative (-0.67 Wm-2) than global insolation (-0.35 Wm-2). 
The slopes were less negative (-0.48 Wm-2, -0.35 Wm-2) at higher solar zenith angle for 
both the cases. Diffuse insolation, in general, showed gradual increase with increase in 
AOD500 but it reached plateau at higher solar zenith angle with AOD500 beyond 0.2. 
Surface insolation over land 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

352
Diffuse fraction was found to show sharp increase between 0.12 to 0.28 and 0.18 to 0.38 
at low (17.46) and high (41.1) solar zenith angles with increase in AOD500 between 0.1 
to 0.6. But the higher diffuse fraction was noticed at higher solar zenith angles for similar 
AOD500. It was found that there was practically little decrease (3-7%) in global, direct 
and diffuse insolation with increase in water vapour between 1.5 to 6.5 cm (Figure 5b). 
The decrease was still less for ozone (Figure 5c) varying between 240 to 290 dobson 
units.

20.7.2 Methods of validation 

20.7.2.1 Comparison with in-situ measurements 
The INSAT 3D daily insolation estimates averaged over 3 x 3 pixels centred over ISRO-
AMS (Bhattacharya et al, 2009) and eddy tower locations will be compared with in situ 
measurements from CM3 pyranometer. One year data from at least 10 locations of AMS 
over different climatic conditions will be used. The selection criteria for choosing quality 
validation datasets are described below : 
a) Days with daily insolation estimates constituted from at least one instantaneous 
insolation per hour between 00 GMT to 1300 GMT will only be used for 
validation. These maintain diurnal symmetry to produce reliable daily integral 
b) The days with in situ continuous half-an-hourly measurements are retained for 
validation. The days with any data loss due to communication failure will be 
rejected. 
c) Diurnality and seasonality checkings will be carried out 
d) Error statistics in the form of bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and 
correlation coefficient will be generated. 

20.7.2.2 Comparison with other sources of spatial data 
Comparison with other sources of insolation product over India or overlapping region 
such as insolation from MSG over Africa or insolation from GMS partly over Indian sub-
continent, reanalysis product for one year and generation of error statistics, histogram

20.7.3 Validation results 
 20.7.3.1 Initial validation of instantaneous insolation estimates from limited 
observations of INSAT 3D Imager 
In this study, INSAT 3D instantaneous surface insolation was compared with in situ 
measured incoming shortwave radiation by four-component net radiometer (model : 
CNR-1) placed at AMS at a height of 4 m from ground. The transmitted data through 
INSAT 3A were received at Bopal Earth Station (BES). The in situ data at half-an-hour 
interval for Hyatnagar (17.82N, 78.98E), Andhra Pradesh, Chakdah (23.06N, 88.54E), 
West Bengal, Sriharikota (13.62N, 80.22E), Andhra Pradesh, Hoshangabad (22.70N, 
77.75E ), Madhya Pradesh, Khazwal (23.53N, 93.18E), Mizoram, Chilika (19.71N, 
85.19E), Orissa were used to validate the INSAT 3D based estimates. The data coverage 
was good for AMS at Hyatnagar and Hoshangabad. The AMS data coverge was less in 
rest of the locations. Altogether 90 (ninety) datasets could be obtained from AMS for 
validation for the period 1 to 15 October 2013.

Figure 10. Validation of INSAT 3D instantaneous insolation with limited measurements 
 from AMS 

The operational product (K1-VHR-INS) of instantaneous insolation estimates at 8 km 
spatial resolution from Kalpana-1 VHRR were obtained for 0330, 0500, 0530, 0600, 
0630, 0700, 0730, 0800, 0830, 1130 for 1 to 15 October 2013 were obtained through 
MOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). The mean insolation from diurnal instances of 
Kalpana-1 VHRR was compared with mean insolation from Imager. 
A comparison was made between insolation estimates averaged over 3 x 3 pixels (~ 12 
km x 12 km) and in situ point measurements from Agro-Met Station (AMS) at coincident 
timings during 1 to 15 October 2013. There was significant correlation (r = 0.72) between 
these two from 90 paired datasets (Figure 6). This showed a mean bias of 37 Wm-2 and 
RMSE of the order of 16.8% of measured mean from AMS. The RMSE has been reduced 
substantially as compared to reported RMSE (25%) of instantaneous insolation from 
Kalpana-1 VHRR estimates averaged over 64 km x 64 km and with respect to AMS-
based point measurements. The scatter of points around 1:1 line could be due to 
differences in scale mismatch between estimates and measurements leading to loss of 
sub-pixel cloud heterogeneity. 
A qualitative comparison (Figure 7) was made between Imager and VHRR insolation 
for 0730 GMT on 13 October 2013 to look into the impact of better resolution (0.04 deg) 
of Imager on insolation specially in cloudy patches.

Finer gradation of insolation variation was seen over central India and Phailin affected 
eastern India in case of Imager as compared to Kalpana-1 VHRR with 8 Km spatial 
resolution. 
The difference of mean instantaneous insolation over cloudy patches (Figure 8) in eastern 
India on 13 October 2013 between Imager and VHRR is shown in Figure 8. Majority of 
the difference was in the range of 10 30 Wm-2. 
20.7.3.3 Sources of uncertainties 
The possible sources of uncertainties that contribute to errors in K1VHRR daily 
insolation estimates are outlined below : 
Input levels 
(i) Inherent accuracies of products of aerosol, atmospheric water vapour 
(ii) Inaccuracy of cloud and fog mask 
(iii) Uncertainty of periodic updation of calibration coefficient of VIS band 
Model structure 
(iv) Cloud-top reflectivity is considered, no cloud absorption is considered for cloud 
attenuation

(vi) Diffuse insolation from cloud is not considered 
Ground validation 
(vii) 
Scale mismatch between estimates and measurements 
The insolation product will be generated at 4 km spatial scale which may not 
sometimes capture the sub-pixel variability of thin haze, clouds or early morning or 
late afternoon fog and their influence on insolation which can be captured through 
pyranometers at tower foot-print scale of few meters. The use of estimates averaged 
over 3 X 3 pixels for validation with measurements at tower foot-print scale may be 
valid for cloudless skies. But it may lead to underestimation if cloud patches are 
present and irregularly distributed in the surrounding pixels but not in the central 
pixel. It may lead to overestimation if cloudy patches are only present in the central 
pixel representing tower location but not in the surrounding pixels. 

(viii) Difference in temporal sampling 
The ISRO-AMS observations on incident shortwave radiation were sampled at 5 
minutes interval and averaged over half-an-hour. Imager will sample with 
instantaneous snapshots at 30 minutes interval. Therefore, it misses out intermittent 
cloud presence and its spatio-temporal dynamics. These differences must have 
introduced some uncertainties in the validation results. 
Sensitivity analysis showed little influence of ozone and water vapour content on 
insolation at different solar zenith angles. But strong sensitivity of AOD at 550 nm was 
observed on insolation. Single scattering albedo (
 was assumed 1.0 in the present 
model. In reality, it varied between 0.7603 to 0.9921 among urban-rural-ocean aerosol 
types (Li 1998). 
20.8 Limitations of algorithm and issues in operational scenario 
Present algorithm has the following limitations : 
 The present algorithm does not consider scattering of incoming solar radiation 
with raindrops. Therefore, it will lead to inaccuracies in cloudy-sky conditions 
with rain occurrence. 
 Cloud has different proportions of liquid water and ice. Attenuation by them 
individually is not considered. 
 Under cloudy-sky conditions a constant precipitable water of 5.5 gcm-2 was 
assumed which may not be always true. 
 All aerosols were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Perturbations by 
aerosols below cloud were not considered. 
 Ground brightness and cloud top albedo are represented by minimum VIS TOA 
albedo of previous 30 days. Instead, minimum shortwave albedo needs to be used. 
 Apart from the above, the sources of uncertainties enumerated in the validation 
section (section 1.6.3.1) are the sources of inaccuracies. 
Surface insolation over land 
INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 

359
20.9 Future scope of improvement 
 Megha-Trophique (MT) ScaRaB data can be utilized to know the relation 
between VIS spectral albedo and shortwave albedo radiance, fluxes which will 
help in computing shortwave albedo including surface and cloud-top. The relation 
can be extended to INSAT VIS band data to know the minimum ground 
brightness. 
 Revised cloud transmission should be introduced separately for different cloud 
types of low, medium and high level for different background land types. 
 The near-real time diurnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm from INSAT 3D 
Imager would help minimize the uncertainities introduced by aerosol 
climatology. The network of diurnal measurements of aerosol optical depth and 
its other properties from 10 IMD land stations or AERONET over India can be 
explored to offset bias in AOD estimates. The real-time availability of these data 
would help remove the residual bias. 
 Bias correction model would be developed from validation results from one year 
datasets and will be applied later to improve the accuracy. 
 Quality flag should be tagged with insolation product.

1.2 Introduction 

1.2.1 Overview and background 
 Geopotential height fields (GPH ) at a pressure level indicate the source and sinks of air 
masses. Generally high pressure areas have relatively higher geopotential heights than 
low pressure areas. It is also a fundamental quantity that is used in atmospheric general 
circulation models. At mid-latitudes they also indicate the underlying large-scale waves 
such as Rossby waves. By looking at the geopotential heights one can infer the first guess 
atmospheric wind pattern (also known as geostrophic approximation) especially for mid-
latitudes. 

1.2.2 Objective 
To derive geopotential heights at 40 pressure levels from 1000 hPa to 0.1 hPa. 

1.3 Inputs 
1.3.1 Static Data 
Topographic data at sounder horizontal resolution. 

1.3.2 Dynamic Data

1.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
1.4.1 Theoretical Background

Where Ro = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. By using H instead of Z, one 
can use g = 9.8 ms-2, a constant value in calculations. In reality, g decreases slightly with 
altitude. Difference between Z and H can be as much as 16m at the height of 10 km 
above sea level depending on pressure, temperature and humidity profile. Error in Z 
depends on error in retrieved temperature, specific humidity profiles as well as the 
surface pressure from analysis. Assuming pressure estimates are error free, a 0.5 K error 
in estimation of layer mean virtual temperature results in about 10 meter error in Z. Thus 
the error in Z is very much dependent on the uncertainties in the retrieved temperature 
and specific humidity profiles (Roland Stull, 2000). 

1.4.2 Operational Implementation 
Once temperature and humidity profiles are available from surface and all 40 standard 
pressure levels, Z can be estimated from the formula described in the previous section. 
Layer mean virtual temperature (between pressure levels p1 and p2) may be estimated by

1.6.2 Methods of Validation 
Difference between radiosonde/reanalysis geopotential heights, mean bias, standard 
deviation etc are calculated. 

1.7 Technical Issues (limitation etc.) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and 
humidity profiles. A simple calculation assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa shows 
that a 0.5 K error in 
vT will result in about 10 m error in 500 hPa geopotential height. To 
a first approximation, error in 
vT is of the same order of T. Hence achieving less than 10 
m error in 500 hPa geopotential height demands that errors in retrieved temperatures be 
less than 0.5 K.

2.2 Introduction 
2.2.1 Overview and background 
Water vapor content in the atmosphere modifies the air mass characteristics. Presence of 
air mass lightens the air mass thereby increasing the potential for convective activity. As 
an air parcel rises, it cools dry adiabatically until saturation vapor pressure is reached. 
Once saturation vapor pressure is reached some of the water vapor condenses forming 
liquid droplets, and releasing latent heat. This latent heating reduces the amount of 
cooling and makes the air parcel more buoyant. This information is very essential for 
accurate prediction of weather and goes as an input parameter in numerical weather 
prediction models. 
2.2.2 Objective 
To compute layer precipitable water in three layers i.e. 1000hPa-900 hPa, 900-700 hPa, 
and 700-300 hPa and total precipitable water in the vertical column of atmosphere 
stretching from surface to about 100 hPa.

which water vapor amount is assumed to be in negligible). Unit of precipitable water is 
mm depth of equal amount of liquid water above a surface of one square meter (if 
pressure is in Pa and specific humidity is in Kg/Kg).

3.2 Introduction 

3.2.1 Overview and background 
Lifted index is an indicator of convective activity. It is calculated in the following steps. 
1. Mean boundary layer (usually lowest 100 hPa layer) temperature and humidity 
are calculated. 
2. A parcel of air with the above calculated temperature and humidity is lifted from 
the middle of the boundary layer dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level 
and then moist adiabatically up to 500 hPa. 
3. The environmental temperature minus the parcel temperature at 500 hPa 
calculated in the above step is the lifted index (LI). 
If the parcel temperature is warmer than the environmental temperature it indicates that 
the parcel can rise further on its own and LI will be negative. Based on a large number of 
LI calculations from radiosonde observations, it is observed that LI less than -5 implies a 
very strong likelihood of thunderstorm activity. Time sequence of geographical pattern of 
LI may be monitored to study large scale convective activity and its relation to synoptic 
circulation systems (Hayden et al., 1996). 

3.2.2 Objective 
To calculate Lifted Index (LIS) from temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from 
the INSAT sounder. 
3.3 Inputs

3.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 
3.4.1 Overview 
3.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
 Given boundary layer pressure, specific humidity and temperature, one can lift the parcel 
to 500 hPa dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level (LCL) and from LCL to 500 
hPa moist adiabatically and thereby compute the parcel temperature at 500 hPa. 
Environmental temperature at 500 hPa is the retrieved temperature at 500 hPa. Lifted

temperature.

The difference P2-P1 should be small enough so that the moist lapse rate does not change

this method. Error in the Lifted Index calculated this way will depend on error in 
retrieved temperature and humidity profile.

4.2 Introduction 

4.2.1 Overview and Background 
Evaporative cooling of falling rain is often a much larger effect than the liquid water 
loading. In regions such as the western Great Plains of the United States (e.g. near 
Denver), the environmental air is often so dry that evaporative cooling causes dangerous 
downdraft called downbursts. Hazardous downbursts can occur even under cloud bases 
where precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground. The smaller-diameter but 
intense downbursts are called microbursts. Downbursts of 0.5 to 5 km in diameter have 
been observed. For extreme cases, downdraft speeds of nearly 10 m/s have been observed 
100 m above ground. This is particularly hazardous to landing and departing aircraft, 
because this vertical velocity can sometimes exceed aircraft climb rate. Doppler radars 
can detect some of the downbursts and give early warning to pilots (Roland Stull, 2000). 
In India dry desert regions, elevated plains, mountain regions where air is very dry may 
be susceptible to microburst. Generally dry microburst occurs in situations characterized 
by high convective cloud bases and strong evaporational cooling in the sub-cloud layer, 
resulting in little or no precipitation at the surface. 

4.2.2 Objective 
To compute dry microburst index based on an empirical formula.

 - lapse rate (oC km-1) of the layer from 700 hPa to melting level (i.e. layer at 0o C), T 
Temperature (oC), Td Dew point (oC). Usually DMI is not calculated for any retrieval 
unless the following three conditions are satisfied: 
(1) > 6 K km-1 ( somewhat stable for convective activity) 
(2) (T - Td)700 >= 8 K (implies a very dry atmosphere close to surface) 
(3) (T-Td)500 <= 8 K (implies some level of saturation at this level) 
Suitability of these conditions needs to be studied for the Indian region.

4.6 Validation 
Doppler weather radar observations of dry micro burst index may serve as validation tool. 
Wind shear data from aircrafts may also give some data for validating dry microburst 
index. 

4.6.1 Data Required 
Doppler weather radar observations of dry micro burst events may be useful in validation. 
Wind data during aircraft landing may also give some indication of dry microburst events 
whenever they occur which may also be used for validation. 

4.6.2 Methods of Validation 
Conventional/direct comparison of computed and observed quantities. 

4.7 Technical Issues (Limitation etc.) 
As the index is based on observations over USA where Great Plains with a very dry air 
exists, applicability over Indian region may require slight modifications. For instance 
more emphasis may be given to study of meteorological conditions leading to dust storms, 
etc. and development of suitable indices. As the sounder gives vertical profiles of 
temperature and humidity only over cloud free regions, one may not be able to detect 
such events from sounder retrievals.

5.2 Introduction 

5.2.1 Overview and Background

Where - Potential temperature, L Latent heat of condensation, q Specific humidity, 
T Temperature, Cp Specific heat of dry air at constant pressure. 
As the moisture decreases with height, e also decreases with height and reaches a 
minimum in the middle troposphere, then increases again into the upper troposphere. The 
maximum vertical e differential between the boundary layer and middle troposphere is a 
measure of atmospheric instability in the vertical direction. Larger the theta-e differential, 
more unstable is the atmosphere in the vertical direction. A quantity called dry microburst 
potential index (MDPI) is calculated by dividing thetaed by 30. As this formula for MDPI 
is empirical, its suitability over the Indian region needs to be studied.

(See section 5.2.1 for details). 
It is different from potential temperature in the sense that it is dependent on the moisture 
content (moisture content provides additional energy in the form of latent heat release). 
Its values will be high at lower levels due to presence of water vapor and decreases as 
one reaches middle troposphere. If lower troposphere is very humid and middle 
troposphere is very dry then there will be a large vertical difference in equivalent 
potential temperatures which is indicative of microburst potential if convection were to 
happen (Pryor et al., 2002). 

5.4.2 Operational Implementation

RQ QL/12 but not >1, QL Mean mixing ratio (g/Kg) in lowest 1 km 
T Lapse rate (oC km-1) from surface to melting level, QM Mixing ratio at melting level. 
WI provides guidance on the maximum possible wind gusts that can occur with given 
atmospheric conditions, if convection were to occur. This is useful for generating short-
range warnings and forecasts (Pryor et al., 2002). 

6.2.2 Objective 
Calculate WI from INSAT sounder retrievals 

6.3 Inputs 
6.3.2 Dynamic Data 
Geopotential heights of standard pressure levels, temperature and humidity retrieved 
from the sounder.

6.4.2 Operational Implementation 
1) From the retrieved temperature profile at standard pressure level, the pressure level at 
which temperature reaches 0o C is estimated by means of interpolation. Height of the

melting layer is then estimated by using the standard formula based on hydrostatic 
approximation. 
2) Mixing ratio at melting level is also obtained by means of interpolation of retrieved 
humidity. 
3) Mean mixing ratio in the lowest one km is also estimated by using retrieved specific 
humidity profile at standard pressure levels. 
4) Lapse rate between surface and melting layer is easily estimated by dividing surface 
temperature by height of the mixing layer (in km). 
These parameters are substituted in the formula for WI given in section 6.2.1.
