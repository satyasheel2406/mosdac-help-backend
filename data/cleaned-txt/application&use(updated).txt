2e. Cloudburst:
MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre) provides cloudburst potential alerts for the Western Himalayan region, specifically focusing on nowcasting (short-term, very-high-resolution forecasting) of extreme rainfall events. These alerts are generated using the in-house model NETRA (Nowcasting of ExTreme orographic RAinfall events) and are available on the MOSDAC web portal. 
Cloudburst Definition:
Cloudbursts are sudden, very heavy rainfalls, typically of short duration and localized nature, often associated with thunderstorms. 
MOSDAC's Role:
MOSDAC, developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC), utilizes data from the INSAT series of satellites to generate these alerts. 
NETRA Model:
The NETRA model is specifically designed for nowcasting extreme rainfall events in mountainous regions, like the Western Himalayas, where orographic (terrain-induced) effects play a significant role. 
Alert Frequency:
The heavy rainfall and cloudburst potential alerts are updated every half hour at a resolution of 0.1x0.1 degrees. 
Experimental Nature:
It's important to note that these alerts are considered experimental and should be used in conjunction with other reliable data sources for interpretation. 
Western Himalayas Focus:
The alerts are particularly focused on the Western Himalayan region, including parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where cloudbursts are more frequent and have caused significant damage in the past. 
Vulnerability:
The terrain of the Western Himalayas makes certain locations more vulnerable to cloudbursts due to their geographical configuration. 
Data Acknowledgement:
The MOSDAC web portal acknowledges the use of data from various sources, including Bhuvan (NRSC) and OpenStreetMap.
