Snow Cover Mapping & Fractional 
Snow Cover 

2.2. Introduction 
Algorithms is developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D(R) Meteorological payload. The 
snow mapping algorithm uses a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized Difference Snow 
Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and to 
map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow mapping, as snow reflects strongly 
in the visible region but absorbs in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of the spectrum. The reflectance 
of clouds is high in the visible as well as short-wave IR. This characteristic is used to identify and 
map snow cover. Coarse resolution binary snow product from INSAT 3D imager will be further 
used to generate fractional snow cover product in synchronous with available high resolution snow 
cover products. 
Validation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data of 
Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be 
carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS derived snow maps. The accuracy of the 
snow maps may vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snow map algorithm has been and will 
continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined from field 
measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the expected 
maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm.

1.2.1. Overview and background 
The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from 
INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used successfully 
to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days snow covered digital 
map products will be generated. 
Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. 
This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster 
and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are covered by snow during winter time. Area of 
snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can affect stream flow during spring 
and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is 
highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt 
and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni et al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and 
reflectance of snow is an important parameter for various climatological and hydrological 
applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche 
investigation. 
Snow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, the 
potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development of higher 
temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, satellite 
sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been used 
successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et al. 2006). This is possibly due to 
distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared region. 
Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for snowmelt runoff 
modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been extensively used for snow 
cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni 
and Rathore, 2003). Various analysis techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised 
classification) have been used to estimate areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). 
However, major difficulty in snow cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan 
region is mountain shadow and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near 
infrared region. Because of above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual 
interpretation technique is needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping 
cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this problem normalized difference snow index 
method is developed and discussed in this document. In optical region snow reflectance is higher 
as compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow 
reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite 
images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has been effectively 
used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al. 
1995).

1.2.2. Remote Sensing of Snow Cover 
One of the earliest methods used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this 
investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band 
2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover 
monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2004). 
This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and 
availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. 
In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was necessary 
because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult 
to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain 
shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised classification technique. 
This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and 
Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). 
Another major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to 
similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud 
can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by 
using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud 
discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern, 
which cannot be seen when area is cloud covered. In visible and near infrared region reflectance 
of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore, discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. 
This is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-
1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In 
these bands, snow has lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has 
been successfully used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et al. 2006). 
Reflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but 
decreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and 
Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes 
incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and 
Noone, 1985; Negi et al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or 
volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a 
reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its 
reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose. 
Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance 
from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can 
be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component 
characteristic of forward scattering increases.

1.2.3. Objective 
The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from 
INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which 
was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. Daily snow and 
maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated. 
This algorithm will be further modified, with NDVI adopted from other sources and infrared 
brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively.

1.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
1.4.1. Overview 
A grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm 
was selected for the following reasons: 
 Sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS, have been used for 
generating the snow products using similar algorithm. (Hall et al., 1995; Kulkarni et al., 2006; 
Singh et al., 2013; Rathore et al., 2015). 
 The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar 
illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as 
Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2006). 
 INSAT 3D(R) Met payloads has a channel in 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial resolution. 
Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number INSAT 3D(R) 
1&2 channels are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km 
resolution. 
 SWIR reflectance/Brightness temperature will be used to identify certain type of clouds which 
were not separated using NDSI threshold. Threshold values will be fine-tuned. This will be 
initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of Space Applications Centre and then 
sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D(R) data. 
 AWiFS derived snow cover products will be used to estimate snow part in synchronous INSAT 
pixel to develop approach for estimating fractional snow cover product for INSAT data. 
It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal, 
and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the product is generated. 
Snow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The 
Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from many 
other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A similar index 
for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been proven to be 
effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year (Tucker, 1979 and 1986). 
Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished using the NDSI. 
Other promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, spectral-
mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable for automatic 
application at the mountainous region. They are also computationally intensive. Training or the 
interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application of techniques such as neural-
network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional applications and possibly even global 
application in future years.

In fractional snow cover, presently snow cover products derived using AWiFS data will be used to 
develop the approach. INSAT derived snow was matched with synchronous AWiFS snow pixels 
which was used to develop a relationship for snow fraction of INSAT pixel. 
1.4.2. Theoretical Background 
 1.4.2.1. Snow cover map 
The snow-cover mapping algorithm is designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A regional, 
daily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will be generated 
by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield maximum snow extent for 
the 10-day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit during that period, then that pixel 
will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free on all of the other orbits during the 10-
day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the 
data product. 
There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps 
(Kulkarni et al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps 
and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer composition periods, e.g., 7 days 
to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this period optimizes the ground coverage 
from the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily 
basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite 
product for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done using 
the daily data. 
1.4.2.2. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) 
The NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus 
clouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance difference 
between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is insensitive to a wide range 
of illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al. 2006). The NDSI is analogous to the normalized-
difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI 
can be computed as given below; 

NDSI = (VisibleINSAT B1 - SWIRINSAT B2) / (VisibleINSAT B1 + SWIRINSAT B2) 
Pixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI values 
more than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et al. 2006). 
These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, 
comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et al, 2004). 
Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. Snow in 
mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be distinguished by 
its high NDSI value (Negi et al. 2006). Since bandwidth of AWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D(R) 
imager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be established using Field Spectral Data

Library of Space Applications Centre (Singh et al. 2005 and Negi et al. 2006). This will be further 
evaluated during post launch period, by carrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et al. 2006). 
In forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly classify 
these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et al. 2006). NDVI and 
NDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. 
Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using the 
NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas 
without compromising the algorithm performance for other land covers. Since appropriate bands 
are not available in INSAT 3D(R) payload, mask will be used from other existing source. 
Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water 
from snow. 
1.4.2.3. Snow / Cloud Discrimination 
Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow 
reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their 
generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum 
(Kulkarni et al. 2002a), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of 
the spectrum. 
While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or 
discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show 
that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds have high 
reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold value and will be 
used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will further be improved due to 
availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D(R) Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature 
threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov and Tarpley, 2003) or cloud removal 
will also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT 
3D(R) derived product. This will be additional criteria than in built criteria of NDSI.

1.4.2.5. Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold 
In order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, sensitivity tests of 
individual threshold values were carried out. Sensitivity analysis will be carry out to identify NDSI 
threshold for INSAT 3D(R) snow products. This threshold value will also be verified using FFC 
combination for snow covered area identification. 
1.4.2.6. Fraction Snow Cover 
Snow binary product of INSAT 3D data, available at coarse resolution, will be used to convert into 
fractional snow cover which will be helpful to improve the snow cover areal extent based on 
occupancy of that pixel in terms of actual snow fraction present in respective pixel of INSAT 3D. 
Synchronous INSAT and high resolution satellite derive NDSI and snow cover product were 
selected for the winter season. Different months and terrain in Himalayan region was chosen to 
represent to take care possible scenarios. INSAT derived NDSI and snow pixel was compared with 
NDSI and snow pixel for high resolution data to develop a relationship between NDSI and snow 
cover areal extent for coarse and fine resolution datasets. This develop relationship will be used to 
generate fractional snow cover area for INSAT dataset and will be helpful to improve daily snow 
cover areal extent from geostationary platform. 
1.4.3. Operational Implementation 
Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: 
In this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness 
temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D(R) data. The radiometrically 
processed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and geometrically 
corrected product to be used further in algorithm. 
Step 2 : Cloud elimination 
This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D(R) image. Cloud screening is based on 
SWIR reflectance/temperature data, or cloud mask product will be used subject to its availability, 
and this will help to clear cloudy pixels. 
Step 3 : Generation of NDSI image 
Normalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio of visible and 
SWIR channel as given below; 
NDSI = (R INSAT B1 R INSAT B2) / (R INSAT B1 R INSAT B2) 
where R is the reflectance of the respective channel. 
Step 4: Generation of Fractional snow pixel 
A developed relationship will be used to convert INSAT 3D coarse resolution pixel into fractional 
snow cover pixel for the respective pixel.

1.6. Validation and Error Analysis 
1.6.1. Field Spectroradiometer data 
Field data of snow and other ambient objects will be collected and analyzed for the wavelength 
bands in INSAT 3DR. These value will be used to verify NDSI threshold to discriminate snow 
from other existing land cover features. 
1.6.2. Visual Snow Cover Map 
Snow cover pixel will be identified visually and will be verified on automated snow cover product 
generated using INSAT 3D(R). This may also be extended to visually map snow covers and 
validate these map with operationally derive snow cover products. 
1.6.3. Comparison of INSAT 3D(R) snow maps with AWiFS snow products 
INSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by 
AWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap 
results with these independently produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified that will 
permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one another. 

1.7. Future Scope 
This algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI (available from AWiFS product 
or any other source) and infrared brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and 
identify cloud pixels, respectively. INSAT 3D being a coarse resolution satellite, Approach using 
AWiFS snow products has been developed, however scatterplot shows a spread over different 
range which could be due to geolocation error. An attempt will also be made using different 
techniques such as homogeneity test, histogram matching etc. to reduce the scatter due to mismatch

probably arising due to geolocation error. This will further help to improve fractional snow cover 
product to improve the accuracy of snow cover areal extent.

Biomass Burning Emission Product 

2.2. Introduction 
Near-real-time estimates of biomass burning emissions are crucial for air quality monitoring. This 
algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) provides a description of new fire characterization 
science product, specifically named as, biomass burning emission product (BBEP) utilizing the 
INSAT-3D/3DR Imager. The INSAT active fire algorithm is a dynamic multispectral thresholding 
contextual algorithm that is based on the sensitivity of the 3.9 m (MIR channel) to high 
temperature sub-pixel anomalies relative to the less sensitive 10.8 m (TIR-1 Channel). The 
current operational version of the INSAT fire product provides information on the location of the 
fire pixel only. In order to characterize the fire in terms of BBEP further details like estimates of 
instantaneous sub-pixel fire size, temperature, and radiative power; ecosystem type; and a 
classification flag needs to be worked out at pixel level. The fire properties are coupled to each 
other, one cannot calculate an instantaneous fire size without estimating a fire temperature, and 
fire radiative power (FRP) is a function of size and temperature. The algorithm will work upon 
accurate estimation of satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) for individual fire pixels. The 
INSAT-3D/3DR satellites observe wildfires at an interval of 1530 min. Because of the impacts 
from sensor saturation, thin cloud cover, and background surface, the FRP values will not be 
continuously observed. The missing observations will be simulated by combining the available 
instantaneous FRP observations within a day and a set of representative climatological diurnal 
patterns of FRP for various ecosystems (evergreen forests, semi-evergreen and deciduous forests 
with their densities like dense, medium and open forests). Finally, the simulated diurnal variation 
in FRP will be applied to quantify biomass combustion and emissions in individual fire pixels with 
a latency of 1 day (0300 UTC 0230 UTC for INSAt-3D & 0315 UTC to 0245 UTC for 3DR; 
following day). It is expected that near-real-time hourly emissions from BBEP would provide a 
crucial component for atmospheric and chemical transport modelers to forecast air quality and 
weather conditions.

2.3. Algorithm Overview 
Biomass burning emissions can be modeled using four fundamental parameters; burned area, fuel 
loading (biomass density), the fraction of biomass combustion, and the factors of emissions for 
trace gases and aerosols. By integrating these parameters, biomass burning emissions can be 
estimated using the following formula (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980): 
E = DM * F = A * B * C * F .(1) 
Where, E = emissions from biomass burning (kg); 
DM = dry fuel mass combusted (kg); 
F = factor of consumed biomass that is released as trace gases and smoke particulates 
A = burned area (km2); 
B = biomass density (kg/km2); 
C = fraction of biomass consumed during a fire event. 

This simple model has been widely applied to estimate fire emissions in local, regional, and global 
scales (Ito and Penner, 2004; Reid et al., 2004; Wiedinmyer et al., 2006; van der Werf et al., 2006; 
Zhang et al., 2008). The accuracy of the emissions depends strongly on the quality of fuel loading 
and burned area estimates, which have high uncertainties (Zhang et al., 2008; van der Werf et al., 
2010; French et al., 2011). Alternatively, Wooster, 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship between 
fuel consumption and total emitted fire radiative energy. This is due to the fact that the total amount 
of energy released per unit mass of dry fuel fully burned is weakly dependent on vegetation types 
and fuel types, which ranges between 16 and 22 MJ/kg (Lobert and Warnatz, 1993; Whelan, 1995; 
Trollope et al., 1996; Wooster et al., 2005). Thus, biomass burning emission is linearly linked to 
fire radiative energy in a simple formula (Wooster, 2002): 
..(2) 
Where; FRP = fire radiative power (MW); 
FRE = fire radiative energy (MJ); 
t1 and t2 = beginning and ending time (second) of a fire event; 
 = biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) 
F = emission factor (g/kg for CO and PM2.5) 
FRE represents the combination of total burned area and the dry fuel mass combusted (e.g., live 
foliage, branches, dead leaf litter, and woody materials) in a given time period, which reduces error 
sources of parameter measurements comparing with the first approach (eq.1) employing both 
burned area and fuel loading in the estimates of biomass burning emissions. Thus, the FRP 
approach will be better to produce BBEP.

Once a fire is identified, Fire Radiative Power (FRP) estimation algorithm will be applied. FRP is 
theoretically a function of fire size and fire temperature. It is empirically related to the difference 
of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle 
infrared (MIR) band (Kaufman et al., 1998). Further, FRP is approximated as the difference of 
MIR spectral radiances between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels in a linear form 
(Wooster et al., 2003). The proposed method is based on the assumption that Fire Radiative Power 
(FRP) is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and 
ambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) channel. Biomass burning emission will 
be computed using eq.2 (Wooster, 2002) below: 
E = 
 FRPdt x x F 
 is biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) which is assumed to be a constant. It is 0.368 0.015 kg/MJ 
based on field controlled experiments regardless of the land surface conditions (Wooster et al., 
2005). This coefficient has been accepted for the calculation of biomass burning emissions from 
MODIS FRP, SEVERI FRP and GOES FRP (Roberts et al., 2009; Ellicott et al., 2009, Zhang et 
al., 2012), and so this value will be adopted. 
F is emission factor (a representative value that is used to represent the quantity of a trace gas or 
aerosol species released into the atmosphere during a forest fire activity. The value is a function of 
fuel type and is expressed as the number of kilograms of particulate per ton (or metric ton) of 
material or fuel. The value for F will be assigned for each emitted species (CO and PM2.5) with 
land cover type according to values published in literature (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Wiedinmyer 
et al., 2006). Specifically, the emission factors will be assigned to stratified land cover types: e.g. 
11.07 g/kg (PM2.5) and 77 g/kg (CO) in forests, 5.6 g/kg (PM2.5) and 84 g/kg (CO) in shrublands, 
9.5 g/kg (PM2.5) and 90 g/kg (CO) in grasslands, and 5.7 g/kg (PM2.5) and 70 g/kg (CO) in 
croplands. 
Although INSAT-3D/R satellites observe the surface every 1530 min, observations of diurnal 
fires may, to a great extent, be obstructed by the impact factors including cloud cover, canopy 
cover, heavy fire smoke, heterogeneity of the surface, large pixel size and view angle of satellites, 
and weak energy release from fire pixels (Giglio et al., 2003; Prins and Menzel, 1992; Roberts et 
al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, missing FRP observations cause a great amount of gaps in the 
spatial and temporal distributions. As a result, FRE in a given time period and region is not able to 
be directly integrated from satellite-observed FRP. To overcome these limitations, the diurnal 
patterns of FRP need to be reconstructed, which will be done by using a climatological value of 
FRP between t1 and t2 as exemplified in fig.1. Since, we will be giving products only over forests 
therefore, different forest density classes and forest types will be considered for making efforts in 
simulating diurnal FRP climatology.

Fig.1. Climatological diurnal FRP (average data from 2002 to 2005) for various ecosystems in 
North America (Zhang et al., 2012) 

To do this, we will adopt the approach that was originally developed to reconstruct diurnal pattern 
of fire size (Zhang and Kondragunta, 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). The climatological FRP will be 
calculated for forest types and their density classes, separately. These FRP data in a half-hourly 
interval will be smoothed using statistical fittings. The offset of shift is determined from the data 
pairs of the detected FRP for the given fire pixel and the corresponding values in the climatological 
curve using a least square method. Because fires in a pixel may not last for a very long time and 
instantaneous fires are not continuously detected due to the impacts from cloud cover, smoke, low 
severity fires releasing limited fire energy, and other factors (Zhang et al., 2011), the fire duration 
will be determined by assuming that fire could be extended 2 hours prior and post instantaneous 
fire detections if the number of the fire detections within a day is more than three times for the 
same pixel. Otherwise, fire occurrences are based on actual satellite detections. Finally, total FRE 
will be computed which is the time integral of fire radiative power (FRP) and FRE has correlation 
between PM 2.5 concentrations and other emissions. 
..(3) 
where ts is the start time of a fire event and te is the end time of the fire pixel. 
For a given material one may assert that the total FRE of a fire is directly related to mass consumed 
by that materials heat of combustion, which can then be related to PM 2.5 and other emissions 
(Kaufman et al., 1998; Wooster et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2005). 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

Because the temporal resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR will range from 15 (together) to 30 min 
(alone), we will set a minimum time step as 30 min. This means that we will calculate FRE by 
assuming that a fire can last for at least a half hour if there is one FRP observation. The half-hourly 
FRE is binned to calculate hourly biomass burning emissions. 
In near-real-time monitoring of biomass burning emissions, we will use INSAT-3D/3DR fire 
products from MMDRPS. The diurnal pattern of FRP will then be simulated for the previous day 
(0300 UTC 0230 UTC for INSAT-3D & 0315UTC to 0245UTC for INSAT-3DR) for estimating 
fire emissions. As a result, the BBEP will be produced with a latency of 1 day. Daily and monthly 
emissions can be given as the sum of hourly values for a given region and an ecosystem type, 
separately. 
2.3.2 Domain of operation 
The domain of application will be kept to 10 - 45N, 45 - 105E (covering SAARC countries, 
presently operational Asia_Mer Sector) and only to forest regions. 
2.3.3 Global scenario 
FRP approach is adapted by WF_ABBA in the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite 
Studies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin [Prins et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 2004]. Particularly, 
the WF_ABBA V65 detects instantaneous fires in subpixels using infrared bands around 3.9 and 
10.7 mm from a network of geostationary satellite instruments that include SEVIRI on board the 
Meteosat-9, and Imagers on board both GOES and MTSAT. It then derives instantaneous FRP 
from radiances in single MIR [Wooster et al., 2003]. Further, to minimize false fire detections, the 
WF_ABBA uses a temporal filter to exclude the fire pixels that are only detected once within the 
past 12 h [Schmidt and Prins, 2003]. The WF_ABBA V65 has been installed in NOAA OSDPD 
(the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution) to operationally produce FRP from 
geostationary satellites since late 2009 (http://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/FIRE/forPo/). The 
NOAA fire product provides detailed information of WF_ABBA V65 fire detections. 
2.4. Assumptions and Limitations 
Several assumptions have been made concerning performance estimates. Meteorological satellite 
instruments are not inherently designed to be able to detect and characterize small sub-pixel hot 
spots. Therefore, performance of the algorithm will be sensitive to instrument noise and other 
anomalies. First of all, the output from the equations is no better than the input Imager data. The 
technique assumes well calibrated Channels that meet current specifications for NedT, co-
registration, diffraction, earth location, saturation, etc. It also assumes that sub-pixel detector 
saturations are flagged and available for application in near real time. If this information is not 
available, sub-pixel characterization is suspect for both saturated and non-saturated fire pixels. The 
algorithm assumes that observed radiances are determined by the fire and non-fire portion of the 
pixel and are only affected by and adjusted for surface emissivity, water vapor attenuation, semi-
transparent clouds/smoke, diffraction, and solar reflectivity (3.9 m band Channel 3 only). 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

Each of the above attenuation (except clouds/smoke) properties are assumed the same for the 
fire pixel and background conditions. 
2.5. 
Validation 
High uncertainty exists in global biomass emissions and accurate validation is currently not 
possible because of the lack of reliable in situ measurement. Therefore, BBEP will be compared 
with other data sources. We will validate our product with the Global Fire Emissions Database 
(GFED), Quick Fire Emission Data (QFED), SEVIRI, Himawari & FY-4A and MODIS products. 
Validation using in-situ measurement using portable instruments will also be attempted.

ATBD of broadband land surface 
albedo from the Imager data of 
INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR 
3.2. Introduction 
Land surface albedo, defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation (0.34.0 um) reflected by 
land surfaces (Dickinson, 1995; Liang, 2004) is one of the most important parameters in general 
circulation models, hydrology models, numerical weather models, and surface radiation-
budget studies. Land surface albedo (LSA) is a key geophysical parameter controlling the energy 
budget in landatmosphere interactions (Dickinson, 1983). LSA varies spatially and evolves 
seasonally based on solar illumination conditions, rainfall, soil moisture, vegetation growth, snow 
accumulation/melting and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing can provide a vantage 
point for estimating land surface albedo at various spectral, spatial, temporal, and angular 
resolutions. During the last few decades, many satellite-generated albedo products have been 
derived with varying spatial resolution of 500 m to 20 km. Many researchers across the globe have 
developed algorithms for various sensors to derive albedo directly from satellite observations. The 
AVHRR algorithm provides global coverage of albedo products (Strugnell & Lucht, 2001). 
POLDER and MISR allow researchers to use multi-angular information to obtain a better 
understanding of surface reflectance anisotropy (Diner et al., 1999; Leroy et al., 1997). The 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product (Schaaf et al., 
2002) utilizes multiple spectral bands to derive accurate broadband albedo estimations at both 
high spatial and high temporal resolutions. Clouds and the Earths Radiant Energy System 
(CERES) uses broad shortwave band to derive the planetary albedo (Rutan et al., 2006). With the 
development and availability of geostationary satellite sensors, many researchers have focused on 
deriving the diurnal changes of surface albedo based on a much wider range of solar 
illumination angles, such as the Meteosat/SEVIRI albedo product (Geiger et al., 2008; Pinty et al., 
2000).

3.3. Theoretical background 
The conventional methods for estimating broadband albedos rely on a series of steps in the 
processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular modelling, and narrowband-
to-broadband albedo conversions. Unfortunately, errors associated with each procedure may be 
accumulated and significantly impact the accuracy of the final albedo products (Liang, 2003). 
Uncertainties associated with each procedure may be accumulate and may have bearing on final 
output. 
An alternative scheme developed in the earlier studies (Liang et al., 1999, 2003) linked TOA (top-
of-atmosphere) narrowband albedos with three land surface broadband albedos using a 
feedforward neural network without performing any atmospheric corrections. This idea stems 
from earlier study (Pinker et al., 1985) that linearly related TOA and surface broadband albedos. 
Surface broadband albedo depends on surface spectral reflectance as well as atmospheric 
conditions. TOA observations contain information on both surface reflectance and atmospheric 
optical properties, which implies that it is possible for us to compute the broadband albedos using 
TOA narrowband albedos without performing any atmospheric corrections. 
Liang et al. (1999) used the MODTRAN model to simulate TOA reflectances under the 
Lambertian assumption, and they obtained a relationship between MODIS TOA reflectances and 
broadband albedos by using a neural network method. Liang et al. (2003) used the projection 
pursuit regression method. However, these two studies did not consider the anisotropy of 
the land surface. Liang et al. (2005) further improved it for estimating daily land surface albedo of 
the Greenland ice sheet from MODIS data. They used the discrete ordinates radiative transfer 
program for a multilayered plane parallel medium to simulate TOA reflectances of snow/ice 
and then developed the relationship between bidirectional TOA reflectances and broadband 
albedos using an empirical training method; they divided the solar/view geometry space into 
angular bins and calculated the regression coefficients of each angular bin using a linear regression 
method. Qu et al. (2015) have provided detailed review of algorithms for albedo. 
Here, we propose to develop a direct-estimation algorithm by employing an atmospheric 
radiative transfer code to simulate the TOA directional reflectances in the two spectral bands of 
INSAT-3D Imager located in visible (0.55-0.75 um) and shortwave infrared- SWIR (1.55-1.70 
um) wavelengths and also calculate the broadband reflectance in the shortwave band (0.4-2.5 um), 
and then establishing a relationship between the TOA reflectances and the broadband 
reflectance using the regression method, which would yield narrow to broadband conversion 
coefficients. 
An approach for estimating land surface broadband albedo from multispectral remote sensing 
observations is a hybrid approach that combines extensive radiative transfer simulations 
(physical) with regression methods (statistical). It directly links the TOA radiance or reflectance 
to surface broadband albedo without performing different processes as per the first approach. Here 
narrowband-to-broadband spectral conversion by considering the spectral response function of 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 37 

the sensor in various spectral bands of the instrument is the main step required to derive the 
albedo. Figure 1 shows the spectral signatures of major surfaces with the relative spectral 
response (RSR) of INSAT-3D Imager instrument. A weighting factors (Narrow to broad band 
conversion coefficients) are to be determined with the radiative transfer simulations. This 
approach has been successfully used to estimate broadband albedo from MODIS data (Liang 
et al., 2003).

spectrum range shown with the RSR of two spectral bands: visible (solid line) and SWIR (dashed line) of 
INSAT-3D Imager instrument. 

3.4. Methodology 
In the present study, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is not taken into 
consideration and the surface is assumed to reflect isotropically (i.e. equally at all angles), so this 
albedo is referred to as the "diffuse albedo" or the "hemispherical albedo". When the land surface 
is assumed as lambertian (the reflectance is isotropic from different solar/view angles), the value 
of Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) is then equal to the albedo and the surface broadband 
albedo can be estimated from linear combinations of narrowband albedo (spectral directional 
reflectance) with different weight coefficients. This method was first proposed by Brest and 
Goward (1987) and was then applied to different sensors: AVHRR (Saunders, 1990; Russell et al, 
1997), Landsat TM (Duguay & Ledrew, 1992; Knap et al, 1999), Meteosat (Valiente et al., 1995) 
and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (Liang, 2003). Liang (2001) reviewed the 
above studies and provided simple conversion coefficients for estimating broadband surface 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 38 

albedo from a variety of sensors under different atmospheric and surface conditions. The 
validation results show that the conversion formulae are very accurate with an average residual 
standard error around 0.02 (Liang et al., 2003). 

Figure 2. Algorithm flowchart for direct-retrieval of the broadband albedo from the INSAT-3D Imager 
data by generating narrow to broadband conversion coefficients 
For the retrieval of broadband albedo in the present study, the basic procedure consists of three 
major steps as illustrated in figure 2. The first step is to conduct extensive radiative transfer 
simulations using the 6SV code, the second step is to obtain the narrow to broad band conversion 
coefficients by linking the simulated TOA reflectance with surface broadband reflectance using 
linear regression analysis and third step is to apply the narrow to broadband conversion coefficients 
on the INSAT-3D Imager data to obtain the broadband albedo. Various surface reflectance spectra 
of different cover types with different atmosphe ric conditions have been incorporated into 
the radiative transfer simulations. In this study, attempt has been made to estimate land surface 
broadband albedos using TOA directional reflectance, instead of TOA spectral albedos. This 
improvement has in fact greatly simplified this method, since calculating TOA spectral albedo 
requires TOA angular modelling that might introduce large errors. 
3.4.1. Radiative transfer simulations 
For a given atmospheric and surface condition, we need to compute the directional 
reflectance at the top of the atmosphere. Assuming the surface is Lambertian, the upw elling 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 39 

radiance at the TOA can be computed by radiative transfer simulations through 6SV (Second 
Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vector version) code (Vermote et al., 
1997). It is critical to use the representative surface reflectance spectra in data simulations. 
Different surface reflectance spectra covering the spectral range 0.42.5 um representing 
vegetation, sand, water, snow surfaces were interpolated in the study. The simulation outputs 
include total shortwave albedo and spectral albedos that are calculated by incorporating the sensor 
spectral response functions. 
In the 6SV simulations, varying aerosol optical thickness values corresponding to lower to 
higher aerosol loadings, continental aerosol model, and tropical atmospheric profile that also 
represent different water vapor and other gaseous amounts and profiles. The aerosol model used 
are the defaults in 6SV and atmospheric profiles over Indian region were used in the simulations. 
For the operational application of this method, more should perhaps be included to represent the 
variable atmospheric conditions. The upwelling TOA radiance (L) is further normalized to 
apparent spectral reflectance (a) using the expression, 

Where, d is the Sun-Earth distance in Astronomical Units, E0 is exo-atmospheric solar 
irradiance and s is the sun zenith angle. Land surface broadband albedo is defined as the ratio 
of the surface upwelling flux (Fu) to the downward flux (Fd) (Liang, 2003), 

where is denoted to the waveband from wavelength 1 to wavelength 2 If 
 albedo is the total shortwave broadband albedo. The wave range (0.4, 
0. and (0.7, 4um) correspond to visible and near-infrared (near-IR) albedos, 
respectively. is the surface spectral reflectance spectra. One of the major limitations in this 
simulation study is its assumption of Lambertian surfaces. The major reason is that we do not have 
a good understanding of the directional reflectance properties of various surface types at the 
INSAT-3D Imager resolution.

3.4.2. Generation of narrow to broadband albedo conversion coefficients 
Once the database is created from the simulations described above, the next step is to link TOA 
reflectance to land surface broadband albedos. This exercise is to be carried out for each of the 
major land cover types. We used regression analysis to establish the linear relationship (equation 
4) between TOA reflectance in two bands of INSAT-3D Imager and LSA and to obtain the arrow 
to broadband (NtoB) conversion coefficients C0, C1, and C2. 

Where is the broadband LSA, while 3D-VIS and 3D-SWIR are the TOA reflectances in 
visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor respectively. A set of NtoB coefficients 
are computed for four major land covers namely, soil, vegetation, water and snow. The physical 
meaning of the conversion factors C1 and C2 is obvious from equation (4). They quantify the ratio 
of the reflected radiances within the narrow bands to the reflected radiances for the visible and 
SWIR broad bands, or the degree of the representativeness of the narrowband reflectance for the 
broadband reflectance. The conversion coefficients developed from extensive radiative transfer 
simulations are then would be applied to the INSAT-3D Imager TOA reflectance data. 
3.4.3. Calibration of the TOA observations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor 
It has been observed that the satellite-level signal in two spectral bands of the INSAT-3D 
Imager instrument significantly underestimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values. This 
factor severely modulates the LSA computations. An exercise was carried out to compensate 
this factor of underestimation from a systematic comparison between TOA radiances of 
INSAT-3D Imager and INSAT-3A CCD and MODIS sensors. After introducing the radiance 
calibration coefficients equation (4) can be rewritten as, 

Where 1 and 2 are radiance calibration coefficients of INSAT-3D Imager instrument. 
Assuming the multiplication of two coefficients 1 and C1 as new coefficient 1, 2 and C2 as 
2 and C0 as 0, equation (5) can be rewritten as, 

3.4.4. Data used and generation of LSA 
Raw digital number data of visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor corresponding 
to 10:30 hrs of 1st of each month of year 2015 was downloaded from the MOSDAC server. The 
digital number data were converted to the TOA radiances, which was subsequently converted to 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 41 

the TOA reflectances using equation (1). A cloud mask was devised from two sources, (a) 
thresholds of INSAT-3D Imager data and (b) MODIS cloud mask. A cloud-free TOA reflectance 
data was then converted to the LSA using the N to B coefficients generated from the simulation 
exercise as discussed in previous section. A land over product available from the MODIS sensor 
was used as a reference for applying land cover-based N to B coefficients. 
3.5. Results 
Monthly broadband LSA maps were derived from the INSAT-3D Imager data representing 1st day 
of each month of the year 2015 using the method discussed in the above section. The broadband 
LSA was derived at a spatial resolution of 4 km over India and surrounding region. The broadband 
LSA maps for different months are shown in the figure 3. Visually the spatial patterns and 
magnitudes of broadband albedo look very reasonable. Majority of the broadband albedo values 
are in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 representing vegetation and soil pixels. However, desert regions show 
LSA value greater than 0.3 and ranged between 0.3 to 0.5. While snow covered regions show LSA 
value greater than 0.4 or 0.5. An error due to clouds still persists even though the cloud mask was 
applied on the images. Fringe of clouds are seen with very high albedo values, which causes an 
erroneous albedo value. A better mechanism for removing clouds has to be developed in future. 
The assumption of a Lambertian surface is being debated (Liang et al., 2003). The key 
argument is that the broadband albedo depends on both spectral and angular properties of the land 
surface. From the validation analysis of the study by Liang et al. (2003), it appeared that an 
assumption of spectral information dominance over the angular information does not lead to 
significant errors, which is an important achievement of this study. Overall it can be said that 
broadband LSA could be successfully computed over India from the INSAT-3D Imager 
observations. 
This is a preliminary study carried out for computing the broadband land surface albedo from the 
INSAT-3D Imager sensor, however detailed study is underway to establish the proposed method 
with more simulations involving additional land cover types. There is also a requirement to 
enhance the cloud removal technique, which will minimize the noise observed in the albedo 
retrieval. Moreover, issue related to the calibration of INSAT -3D Imager radiance has to be 
rectified for robust retrieval of the broadband albedo.

3.6. Summary and Future scope 
In this document, we have presented the algorithm theoretical basis (Version 1.0) for the 
broadband land surface albedo from INSAT-3D Imager dataset. The technique involves 
development of a direct-estimation of broadband land surface albedo from the observations of the 
INSAT-3D Imager sensor, which is available from the geostationary platform. Extensive 
theoretical modelling study was carried out, where an atmospheric radiative transfer model was 
used to simulate the TOA signals in two broad bands of Imager sensor for diverse land atmospheric 
scenario. After the simulation exercise was over, a relationship between TOA reflectances and 
land-surface broadband albedos was developed from the simulation results, which provided a set 
of conversion coefficients. A separate set of narrow to broadband conversion coefficients for 
each of the major land covers was generated for INSAT-3D Imager data. Using the proposed 
method broadband land surface albedo maps were generated over India from the TOA 
observations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Validation of the retrieved albedo will be carried 
out by comparing it with MODIS albedo products and in-situ albedo measurements. The 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 43 

preliminary study has provided encouraging results; however, a detailed analysis is underway 
involving more theoretical simulations and removing the errors due to erroneous cloud mask. 
Moreover, serious issues related to (1) the calibration of INSAT-3D Imager radiance and (2) 
cloud cover have to be resolved for robust retrieval of the broadband albedo on routine basis.

4.2. Introduction 
Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key variables in hydrological cycle, agricultural drought and 
crop yield deviation. It is a term used to describe the combined loss of water due to the evaporation 
largely from soil surface and transpiration from plants. ET is a central process in the climate 
system and a nexus of water, energy & carbon cycle (Jung et.al. 2010). Land evapotranspiration 
(ET) is an essential component in global water, energy and carbon cycles, and provides a link 
between the atmosphere and the Earths surface (Betts et al., 1996; Jimnez et al., 2011; Tang et 
al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015). It is also an important indicator of hydrologic and heat 
variations under a changing climate and anthropogenic interference (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998; 
Ohmura and Wild, 2002; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Accurate quantification of ET is thus critical 
for understanding the hydro-climatologic processes and the interactions of the Earth system 
(Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002). However, the estimation of large-scale ET from ground-based 
measurements alone remains challenging due to the sparse network of point observations and the 
high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of ET (Xu and Singh, 2005; Xue et al., 2013). 
To address this limitation, a number of global ET products have been derived in recent years, 
including remote sensing-based products (Su, 2002; Muet al., 2007, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009, 2010; 
Miralles et al., 2011b; Yang et al., 2013). There are many methods mentioned in the literature 
such as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen 2013), TSEB (Norman & Becker, 1995) and SEBS (Su, 2002). Most 
of the model uses the operationally available polar/ near-polar orbit satellite datasets such as 
MODIS, ASTER, LANDSAT have long been utilized for the estimation of ET from field to 
regional scale. However, the output records suffer from spatial and temporal gaps due to cloud 
cover and in-frequent image availability based on satellite overpass schedule. However, 
geostationary satellites, have high temporal resolution continuously measuring several factors 
related to land surface and the atmosphere over large regional scales. Thus, they have high potential 
in calculating land surface and water cycle at hourly temporal resolution. This shows the vital role 
of geostationary satellite in modelling Evapotranspiration on spatial scale. Operational ET

products are available over US and Europe using thermal remote sensing data from geostationary 
meteorological satellite data such as GOES (Anderson et al, 2007) and MSG-SEVIRI (Hu et al, 
2015). 
4.2.1. Overview and background 
Most of the methods used for modelling evapotranspiration uses energy surface balance framework 
using thermal infrared remote sensing. This describes the heat and water transfer from land surface 
to overlying atmosphere within surface layer of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) : 
Rn- G = H + E (1) 
Where, Rn is the net surface radiation, G is the soil heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux and E is 
the latent heat flux. Remote sensing technique can provide spatial and temporal information of 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), surface albedo, surface 
emissivity, and radiometric surface temperature, most of which are indispensable to the models 
and methods that partition the available energy (Li et. al. 2009 , Mauser et.al. 1998). A large 
number of efforts have been made to incorporate remotely sensed surface temperature in 
combination with other critical variables, e.g., NDVI and albedo into ET modeling during the 
past three decades (kala et.al. 2008). It was Penman (Penman 1948) who laid the foundation for 
relating evapotranspiration to meteorological variables (Allen et.al. 1998). Model simulations or 
empirical equations requiring meteorological data are the traditional way of estimating 
evapotranspiration such as gradient method, Bowen ratio method, eddy covariance method, 
lysimeter method. Malamos et.al. (2015) used PM method to estimate ET on the field scale level 
while Uddin et.al. (2013) used the Bowen ratio method & EC method to estimate latent heat fluxes. 
However, because of some practical reasons like diversity in land covers or temporal changes in 
the landscape, these methods may not represent the evapotranspiration at regional-scale effectively 
(Zhang et.al. 1995) The most frequently used method for estimating evapotranspiration at present 
is the Penman-Monteith equation. The energy balance concept and net radiation are used as the 
principal parameters in most of the remote sensing methods for estimating evapotranspiration (Li 
et.al. 2002). Till date, several energy balance algorithms are available for calculating ET through 
remote sensing. such as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen et.al.1998) and SEBS (Su,2002). They are single 
source model which consider soil and plant as single source. In addition to these, there are dual-
source or two-source (soil and vegetation canopy) models, e.g. TSEB (Norman & Becker 1995), 
SEBI (Menenti & Choudhury 1993) and ALEXI (Anderson, Norman, Diak, kustas & Mecikalski, 
1997). Therefore, considering the characteristics and significance of the various ET methods 
developed over the past decades, precise estimation of ET over regional scale based on the remote 
sensing technology has become a critical question in ET related studies.

4.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 
4.2.3.1. Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR 
The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), 
Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-
3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the 
earth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-
0.75 m), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 m), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 m), water vapor (6.5-7.1 
m) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 m & 11.5-12.5 m) regions. It also has 19 
channel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The 
spatial resolution is 1 km x 1 km for VIS/SWIR band and 4 km x 4 km for thermal IR and 8 km X 
8 km bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) (2014) 
provides both full-globe and sector data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-hour 
interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions 
on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss, 
radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D/3DR data products scheduler. 
This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator 
(TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 columns 
for Asia Mercator sector product. 
4.2.3.2. Required inputs 
Operational all-sky hourly Net radiation product, sliding monthly noon-time composite of land 
surface albedo, instantaneous LST from INSAT 3DR 
The proposed algorithm for ET will use the INSAT Net radiation hourly product in the MMDRPS 
operational chain. The net radiation will be computed from daily insolation product at 4 km from 
INSAT 3D/3DR, proposed operational albedo product from INSAT 3D/3DR, hourly forecast air 
temperature and relative humidity from WRF model, land surface temperature (LST) from INSAT 
3D/3DR, using the surface emissivity obtained from 10 year historical MODIS database or real-
time composite NDVI at 1-4 km from other sources (https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/

National Data Centre, NRSC, Hyderabad for OCM-2 & AWiFS NDVI). The net radiation needs to 
be made operationally available under clear and cloudy sky conditions to generate latent heat flux 
and Evapotranspiration (ET). 
4.2.3.3. Hourly short-range forecast from WRF 
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for 
All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation 
model with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is 
integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km 
for the All India, with grid points 260235, 352373 and 676721 in x and y directions for the 
domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model 
atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available 
conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial 
conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at 
MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database 
and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS. The operational forecast is 
available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at hourly intervals up to 72 hours. Similarly, IMD is 
also running a WRF model in a double domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 9 km 
and 3 km for the RSMC Domain and All India domain respectively. The model has 46 vertical 
levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 50 hPa. In this algorithm only temperature 
and relative humidity at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of ET. For testing 
the prototype algorithm, SAC WRF forecasts at 5km resolution will be used. However, for 
operational implementation in MMDRPS, IMD WRF forecasts will be used.

4.4.1. Clear sky Latent heat flux (E clr) 
The Latent heat flux is computed using the equation (2) given by PM equation (Monteith, 1965) 
Eclr =

 ( 

 ) (2) 
Here, is net available energy (Rn- G) , Eclr is clear sky latent heat flux or evapotranspiration ( 
Wm-2) , s is slope of SVP vs. temperature curve, is air density( kg m-3), is psychometric 
constant(hPa K-1) , cp is specific heat of air (MJ kg-1 K-1), DA is vapor pressure deficit, gB is 
boundary layer conductance ( ms-1), gS is stomatal (or surface) conductance(ms-1) 
The method used here to compute latent heat flux combines satellite TS data (LST) obtained from 
INSAT 3DR with standard energy balance closure models in order to derive a hybrid closure that 
does not require the specification of surface to atmosphere conductance terms (Mallick et.al. 2014). 
This method is referred to as the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC). This method can 
be used by simultaneously solving four state equations as mentioned by (Mallick et.al. 2014) to 
estimate latent heat flux. The four internal state equations needs to be solved in iterative manner 
to compute LE are given below:

Here is the evaporative fraction, T is expressed as Ts-Ta where Ta (oC) is the air temperature 
and Ts is land surface temperature (oC). e& is effective vapour pressure (hPa), e' is atmospheric 
vapour pressure (hPa) at Ta height of measurement and (
 is saturation vapour pressure at Ts. The 
block diagram to compute LE from iterative solution is shown below. In the flow chart (Figure 1), 
TSD is the surface dew point temperature (0C), M is moisture availability at surface (0-1) TD is dew 
point temperature (0C). 
The input needed for computation of E mentioned in equation (2) are air temperature (Ta), LST 
(Ts), Relative humidity (RH), Net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G), For clear sky conditions, 
hourly Net radiation (Rn) product will be used as input. Air temperature and relative humidity will 
be taken from WRF model at 2m height on hourly scale. LST obtained from INSAT 3DR will be 
used on-hourly scale as input to this model. 
In order to solve net surface available energy, (=Rn G) as mentioned in equation (2) and (6) 
we need to obtain soil heat flux. The soil heat flux can be obtained by two approaches:

The ratio of daytime soil heat flux and net radiation from AMS measurements over short vegetative 
systems were found to produce logarithmic relation with INSAT 3A CCD NDVI at 1 km. This 
relation was used to derive the soil heat flux (Bhattacharya et. al . 2014).

It resulted into a significant correlation coefficient of 0.8. The spread is relatively more which 
could be due to difference in situ measurement footprints of soil heat flux and net radiation, and 
INSAT 3A CCD. This function was used to estimate soil heat flux through inversion from regional 
daytime net radiation and INSAT NDVI. 
This relation G = -12.5 ln(NDVI)-1.317 will be used to compute the G/Rn ratio. Using all-sky net 
radiation product from INSAT 3DR and sliding monthly NDVI composite from other sources, 
daytime G and net available energy can be computed. Since nighttime soil heat flux is very 
negligible, daytime G will be scaled to daily 24 hours average G to derive daily . 

Thermal inertia-based (TI) physical modelling approach 
The physical model for the land surface soil heat flux estimate based on the harmonic 
analysis of soil surface temperature (HM model) is described by Murray and Verhoef et.al. (2007) 
as follows: 
 G = *( ( 1 - 
)
* +, )* (
.// 
1
)
 sin(nt + n + 
2
3 
25
)* )) = * Js (7) 
where G (W m2) is the at-surface soil heat flux, (J m2 K1 s0.5) is the soil thermal inertia, M is 
the total number of harmonics used An is the amplitude of the nth soil surface temperature (Ts) 
harmonic, (rad s1) is the angular frequency, t is the time (s), n (rad) is the phase shift of the 
nth soil surface temperature harmonic, and Js is the summation of harmonic terms of soil surface 
temperature. 
The parameter soil thermal inertia, , is a key variable for estimating G0 using Eq. (10). 
Murray and Verhoef adopted the concept of normalized thermal conductivity (O. Johansen 1977) 
and developed a physical method to calculate as 
 = exp [ (1- Sr-)] (* - 0) + 0 (8) 
where and 0 are the thermal inertia for saturated and air-dry soil (J m2 K1 s0.5) respectively. 
Also 0 = -1062.4 * + 1010.8 & * = 788.2 (*-1.29). (cm3 cm3) as soil porosity (equal to 
the saturated soil moisture content); () is a parameter depending on soil texture obtained from 
soil map ; Sr is the mositue availability at surface obtained moisture availability subroutine from 
STIC model. For instantaneous observations using satellite data n =1 and phase can be taken as 
00.

t (s) is time offset between the canopy composite temperature and the below-canopy soil surface 
temperature and is found as 1.5 h in Murray and Verhoef based on their data. With the two boundary 
values (i.e., t =1.5 h for fc=1 and t=0h for fc=0), a linear approach is proposed here to describe 
time offset t as function of vegetation fraction (fc). NDVI data from OCM, MSG-SEVRI or 
MODIS will be used to compute fc

 t= 1.5 fc (10) 
Once the soil heat flux is obtained then is solved if all clear-sky instances prevail throughout 
the day. 
7.4.3 Cloudy sky Latent heat flux (E cld) 
The latent heat flux under cloudy sky conditions can be estimated using equation (2). Under cloudy 
sky conditions LST is not available, so the challenge is to retrieve LST under cloudy-sky condtions 
through inverse modelling. 
4.5. LST retrieval under cloudy-sky 
From the proposed net radiation product, the all-sky net radiation data are pre-requisite for LST 
recovery under cloudy-sky conditions. The net surface longwave radiation will be obtained as a 
difference from net surface radiation and net surface shortwave radiation under cloudy sky 
conditions. Net surface shortwave radiation will be obtained from instantaneous surface insolation 
product and noon-time sliding monthly albedo composite. The incoming longwave radiation will 
be deducted using WRF forecast data to retain outgoing longwave radiation (Rlocld). By inverting 
the equation of stefan-boltzmann law we can recover LST. 
LSTcloud = (Rlocld /(s ))1/4 (11) 
Here under cloudy sky conditions the 30-day composite value of surface emissivity for cloudy 
pixel from from historical MODIS data or sliding monthly NDVI composite will be used. 
If the LST is recovered then by using equation 2, we can obtain latent heat flux under cloudy 
conditions. (LEcld) 
In this case also, like clear sky conditions for solving (Rn G) as mentioned in equation (2) & 
(6) we need to obtain soil heat flux. If LST is recovered under cloudy sky conditions the soil heat 
flux can be obtained by using TI- based model as discussed above. Here, in case of cloudy 
conditions for vegetation fraction (fc) we will use sliding monthly NDVI composite value cloudy 
pixel from external sources. By using equations 7-10 soil heat flux (G) will be computed. 
Once G is obtained using method mentioned in figure (3) cloudy sky Latent heat flux (E cld) 
4.5.1. Daily Evapotranspiration (ET) 
The hourly latent heat flux (W m-2) will be converted in hourly ET (mm) using expression : 
E (mm depth of water per hour ) = (E (Wm-2) * 0.0015) (12) 
This hourly ET will be summed to obtained daily and day time evapotranspiration in mm depth of 
water loss per day. 
4.5.2. AET anomaly 
The Agro-Met Field Units (AMFUs) also require anomaly of AET products from mean for Friday-
Monday and Tuesday Thursday of each week. Once the algorithm is tested, validated and 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 55 

integrated into MMDRPS and declared operational, the algorithm will be for processing of past 
years INSAT 3D and ancillary data to generate long term daily, time-binned AET, mean and percent 
anomaly from mean. 
4.5.3. Steps for operational implementation 
The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of evapotranspiration over 
land (AET) product generation: 
i) 
Three-hourly temperature data at 2-meter surface height from hourly forecast from WRF 
(ASCII format) at 0.03 o X 0.03 o / 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid. 
ii) Conversion of all ASCII outputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 0.04o X 0.04o 
grid resolution as per the INSAT 3DR net radiation product 
iii) The sub setting of LST, current-day noon-time albedo, sliding monthly albedo and NDVI 
composites, net radiation products as per the bounds of Asia sector products. 
iv) Integration of INSAT derived clear sky net radiation, LST with 2-D surface of WRF variables 
in to physical model to generate clear sky latent heat flux. (Eclr) 
v) Integration of INSAT derived cloud mask and cloudy-sky net radiation and recovered LST 
along with 2-D surface WRF variables into physical model to generate cloudy-sky latent heat 
flux (Ecld) 
vi) Computation of daily evapotranspiration in mm day-1 from hourly latent heat flux and time-
binned AET product for four days (Friday Monday) and three days (Tuesday Thursday). 
vii)

4.8. Sensitivity analysis of STIC model simulated latent heat flux on LST 
and Albedo 
The accuracy of STIC model heavily depends on the quality of land surface temperature data due 
to its role in retrieving TSD and M. One-dimensional sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify 
the impacts of uncertainty in TS and albedo on E. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by 
increasing and decreasing LST systematically from its original value while keeping the other 
variables and parameters constant. This procedure was selected because the fluxes and other 
intermediate outputs of STIC model reflect an integrated effect of change in LST. Firstly, surface 
fluxes (E) were computed using the original LST data obtained from EC tower observations. Then 
LST was increased and decreased at constant interval and a new set of fluxes were computed. It 
was found that E was sensitive to the LST uncertainties with a magnitude of error ranging 2-12 
% for LST error in the range of 0.5 - 3K.

5.2. Introduction 
Monitoring of the earths radiation budget is essential for improving our understanding of the 
earths climate and is changes since the radiative energy exchanges at the top of the atmosphere 
(TOA) and at the earths surface regulate the redistribution of energy and determine the energy 
balance of the earth-atmosphere system. Rather than examining radiation budget as a whole, it is 
very important to quantify its components, namely incoming and outgoing shortwave and 
longwave radiation, within the atmosphere, and at the surface. Radiation budget and its different 
components also listed in essential climatic variables of the emerging Global Framework for 
Climate Services (BojinSki et al., 2014). Net surface radiation (Rn) is a key parameter for energy 
and mass exchange between land and atmosphere and also play a vital role in many biological 
processes (Anderson et al. 2007). Radiative energy is the driving force for land surface 
meteorological and micrometeorological processes, such as sensible and latent heat 
(evapotranspiration) transfer. The surface radiation balance is one of the major factors that 
determine the surface temperature of the vegetation canopy and the underlying soil substrate. Thus, 
accurate estimates of Rn are essential for understanding the land surface energy distribution, the 
formation and transformation of air masses, snow melting calculations (Male and Granger, 1981), 
modeling crop transpiration and evapotranspiration, and addressing water resource management 
(Bisht and Bras, 2011). Rn (coupled with other energy balance component such as ground heat 
flux) serves as a key driving force for the evapotranspiration (ET). Estimation of Rn is necessary 
because it is a key input for land surface process and hydrological models, and are also used 
routinely to calculate evapotranspiration (Monteith, 1965; Kustas & Norman,1997), which is a 
critical component of agricultural, hydrological, and ecological research. Over the years, various 
ET and land surface models have been developed that use remote sensing and ancillary surface 
and ground-based observations (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998). All ET models require estimates of Rn 
at spatial scale. Mallick et al (2009) and Westerhoff (2015) were observed sensitivity of Rn from 
10 to 40% for ET over different agro-ecosystems.

at the surface. Mathematically described as:

where Rsi is the incoming shortwave radiation (Wm2), Rso is the reflected outgoing shortwave 
radiation (Wm2), which is calculated by Rso = Rsi, is the shortwave broadband albedo 
(dimensionless), thus Rns is the net shortwave radiation, Rli is the incoming longwave radiation 
(Wm2), Rlo is the outgoing longwave radiation (Wm2), and Rnl is the net longwave radiation 
(Wm2). Rn is normally positive during the daytime because net shortwave radiation dominates, 
but negative during the nighttime because net longwave radiation dominates (Allen et al., 1998). 
If all four components of Eq. (a) are known, the calculation of Rn is straightforward. Indeed, many 
radiation measurement towers measure these four components of radiation, thereby allowing us to 
determine Rn a given instance and location. Various satellite observations have been used to 
generate radiation products at regional and global scales (Liang et al., 2010, 2013b; Zhang et al., 
2014). MeteoSat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG 
SEVIRI) Satellite observations from the visible to near-infrared spectrum have been used for 
estimating incident solar radiation and surface albedo, and thermal-infrared data for estimating 
longwave radiation. To map the Rn, it is necessary to combine remote sensing observations with 
surface and atmospheric data, where the spatial variability is mainly modeled by means of albedo, 
emissivity, and land surface temperature maps obtained from satellite data. There are roughly two 
types of algorithms for estimating Rn (Liang et al., 2010), one calculates radiative quantities from 
the derived satellite products of all relevant atmospheric and surface variables (e.g., cloud, 
atmospheric temperature, LST, air and surface emissivity), and another estimates radiation directly 
from satellite observed radiance using a regression equation established from extensive radiative 
transfer simulations or using ground measurements.

5.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 
5.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR 
The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), 
Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-
3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the 
earth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-
0.75 m), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 m), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 m), water vapor (6.5-7.1 
m) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 m & 11.5-12.5 m) regions. It also has 19 
channel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The 
spatial resolution of VIS band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for WV and thermal IR bands. The 
introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides (Bhattacharya 
et al. 2013) both full-globe and sector data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-
hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 
acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, 
line loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3DR data products 
scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse 
Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 
columns for Asia Mercator sector product. 
5.2.3.2 Operational surface insolation product 
A spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine 
integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations 
from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3DR will be used to provide minimum ground 
brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness 
temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day 
aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme will be implemented 
to obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout 
the day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm has been operationalized 
(Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) and daily insolation product is available at 4 km from INSAT 
3D and at 8 km from Kalpana-1 spatial resolution respectively with Transverse Mercator projection 
routinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). 
5.2.3.3 Operational proposed land surface albedo product 
The proposed algorithm for Rn will use the other proposed INSAT land surface albedo three hourly 
or daily composite product in the IMDPS operational chain.

5.3.3. Operational product of WRF short-range forecast 
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for 
All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation 
model with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. 
The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 
km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260235, 352373 and 676721 in x and 
y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top 
of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all 
available conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model

initial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at 
MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database 
and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar 
et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from India such as Oceansat-2 scatterometer wind data and other 
International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast). The operational forecast is available at finer spatial 
resolution (~ 5km) at hourly interval upto 72 hours. In this algorithm only temperature at 2-meter 
height from surface will be used for estimation of Rn.

5.4. Algorithm functional specifications 
5.4.1. Clear sky net surface radiation (Rnclr) 
Three hourly clear sky day time net radiation over land will estimated using land surface 
temperature, albedo and surface insolation. Rnclr will estimated as function of net shortwave (Rnsclr) 
and net longwave (Rnlclr) :

Rnsclr will be function of instanteous incoming shortwave (Rsiclr) and albedo () and in this 
algorithm the incoming shortwave radiation will be taken from already developed and 
operationalized INSAT-3D product. Whereas, albedo will be taken from the proposed land albedo 
product from INSAT data. Rnsclr will be computed only for day-time.

Where, Tsw = Atmospheric Transmissivity 
Tsw will be derived from the ratio of incoming shortwave radiation (Rsi) to extra-terrestrial radiation 
(Rext). The extra-terrestrial radiation will be computed using astronomical units for INSAT pixel 
for each instanteous acquisition. The air temperature (Ti) will be integrated from hourly daily 
weather forecast from WRF as mentioned in section 2.3.3. 
Rloclr again is function of surface emissivity and land surface temperature as defined in equation

The daily surface emissivity will be generated from 10-years MODIS emissivity product or from 
NDVI products from OCM-2, AWiFS India mosaic products as per the availability and quality of 
data. The land surface temperature will be taken from already operationalize INSAT product. 
Hence by doing computation of equations 1 to 6 Rnclr will be estimated for day time. In night time 
only net longwave radiation will exist hence only equation (3) will be taken in consideration for 
computation of clear sky Rnclr. 
5.4.2. Cloudy sky net surface radiation (Rncld) 
For cloudy pixel the empirical model will be developed among INSAT derived out going longwave 
radiation (OLR), insolation product and measured net radiation from AMS and eddy tower data 
over different agro-climatic conditions of India for day and night time separately. 
Net shortwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rnscld) 
Rnscld_day = (1-) Rsicld ( 7) 
- Albedo will computed from moving last 20-day composite. 
Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during daytime 
 Rlincld_day = f (Ta, RH, CI) (8) 
Where Ta = Air temperature, RH = Relative humidity, CI = Clearness Index 
Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during night time 
Rlincld_night = f (Ta, RH) (9) 
Where, Ta = Air temperature, RH = Relative humidity 
Outgoing longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlocld) during day and night time 
Rlocld = f (OLR, LULC) (10)

Where, OLR= Out Going Long Wave Radiation, LULC = Land Use Land Cover ( From AWiFS, 
provided by NRSC) 
To estimate Rnclr in cloudy sky first the cloudy pixel will be identified by using INSAT generated 
cloud mask for each dataset. Then these empirical model will be applied at spatial scale from 
cloudy-sky acquisition for cloudy pixels. The overall flow of algorithm is shown in Figure 1. 
For each hourly acquisition, clear sky and cloudy sky models simultaneously applied and will 
generate Rn over Indian land mass. To generate daily average net radiation (Rndly) at least one 
acquisition is required in each two hours to compute Rndly. If there is two consecutive hourly data 
gap exists within 24-hours timeframe, then daily net radiation will not be computed. For each 
hourly acquisition, clear sky and cloudy sky models simultaneously applied and will generate Rn 
over Indian land mass. 
5.4.3. Sensitivity Analysis 
The 1-dimensional sensitivity analysis of whole algorithm will be done for net shortwave and net 
longwave in clear sky and cloudy sky. For net shortwave in clear and cloudy sky albedo and for 
net longwave clear sky LST sensitivity will be evaluated. For cloudy sky, weather forecast based 
air temperature and humidity along with INSAT derived OLR sensitivity will be done in future. 
The high resolution (3 Km) and high temporal (1-hour) weather forecast from IMD for evaluation 
of the surface temperature, relative humidity will also be used simultaneously with MOSDAC 
weather forecast to develop algorithm followed by sensitivity analysis.

5.4.4. Steps for operational implementation 
The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of net radiation over land 
(Rn) product generation: 
viii) 
The hourly temperature and humidity data at 2-meter surface height from forecast from 
WRF (ASCII format) at 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid. 
ix) 
Conversion of all ASCII outputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 0.04o X 
0.04o grid resolution as per the INSAT 3D insolation product 
x) 
The sub setting of LST, albedo and insolation products as per the bounds of Asia sector 
products. 
xi) 
Integration of INSAT derived insolation, albedo, LST with 2-D surface of WRF 
variables in to physical model to generate clear sky net radiation (Rn). 
xii) 
Integration of INSAT derived cloud mask and insolation in to empirical model to 
generate cloudy sky net radiation (Rn). 
xiii) 
The clear and cloudy sky net radiation at each hour will be used to generate hourly net 
radiation (Rn) over Indian land mass. 
xiv) 
The average of 24-hours net radiation will be used for generation of daily net radiation 
(Rndly). The pre-condition for generation of Rndly is that there will no consecutive two-
hour data loss within 24-hours of a day.

6.2. Introduction 
The shortwave radiative flux absorbed by the ocean surface plays an important role in the 
atmospheric and oceanic circulation through air-sea interaction particularly over the warm pool 
region of the Indian Ocean [Lukas, 1989]. The accurate information of surface Short Wave 
Radiation (SWR) would also result in significantly improved representation of the intra-annual 
oceanic surface processes and long term surface variability. The diurnal variations in the Sea 
Surface Temperature (SST) are driven by the surface solar radiation that is modulated primarily by 
the presence of cloudiness. The SWR data available through buoys have sparse coverage due to the 
large cost and maintenance involved. In the recent years there have been efforts to establish an 
accurate estimate of the surface shortwave radiation budget (SRB) over Tropical Ocean and to 
assess its impact on the climate change. 
The tropical oceans with SST usually greater than 28 C, forms a major part of the largest warm 
pool on the earth. The variations of surface insolation over these warm pool regions are primarily 
due to the variations in cloudiness which are manifestation of deep convection [Shinoda et al., 
1998; Sengupta et al., 2001]. The long-term surface measurements of radiative fluxes are limited 
primarily to the continental regions [Ohmura and Gilgen, 1991]. The satellite estimates of 
cloudiness and top of the atmosphere fluxes have been used in conjunction with radiative transfer 
models to produce global estimates of SRB over land and ocean [Li, 1995; Rossow and Zhang, 
1995; Whitlock et al., 1995; Gupta et al., 1997]. The most popular algorithms used in computing 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

SRB estimates from satellite data are described by Pinker and Laszlo [1992] and Darnell et al. 
[1992]. 
The global Analysis, such as the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) [Kalnay et 
al., 1996], National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Data Assimilation Office (NASA/DAO) 
[Schubert et al., 1993], and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 
[ERA, 1999] projects have provided climate researchers with alternative estimates of the earths 
SRB. Bony et al. [1997] used data from the NASA/DAO and NCEP reanalysis for the period 1987
88 to compare SWR at the surface to satellite estimates in the Tropics (30S30N). They found 
the annual mean bias in NCEP SWR over the tropical ocean ranging from -10 to -30 W m-2, while 
NASA/DAO SWR biases ranged from -50 W m-2 in subsidence regions of the subtropics to -25 W 
m-2 in convective regions near the equator. 
Table-1 provides a summary of presently available SWR products from different source alongwith 
their merits and demerits. 
Note: LY products largely known as Large and Yeager product follows the earlier approach of Large and Nurser [2001], 
in which the NCEP surface radiation and precipitation are replaced by satellite-based estimates. 
The present Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document describes a methodology to estimate SWR 
from half-hourly estimates of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) obtained from Kalpana 
observations. Although we have shown the results with Kalpana derived OLR, but the same 
algorithm has been tested with the data from other Indian GEO satellites.

6.3. Physical basis of the SWR Algorithm 
The OLR-based SWR estimates have better accuracy for convective regions because the variations 
of surface insolation over the warm pool ocean region are primarily due to the variations in 
cloudiness. Variations in cloudiness are manifestation of deep convection; therefore, OLR is a good 
proxy for convection. Shinoda et al [1998] showed in their study that the coefficient of correlations 
between SWR and OLR were maximum (~0.8) at the equator that decreases as one goes away from 
the equator and reduces to less than 0.5 beyond 10N/S latitudes. 
Shinoda et al. [1998] proposed a simple empirical relationship (referred hereafter as SH98), valid 
over warm pool oceanic regions, to estimate the daily averaged SWR from the daily averaged OLR 
products obtained from the NOAA polar orbiting satellite. Shahi et al. [2010], proposed the use of 
a high temporal resolution data of OLR to improve the diurnal sampling in order to match that of 
the buoy SWR in computing daily averaged estimates. They demonstrated a significant 
improvement in the SH98 by using daytime average of OLR obtained from half-hourly 
geostationary satellite observations. The rationale behind using the daytime OLR as against daily 
(24-hr average OLR) is that the daily averaged SWR is affected solely by the presence of day-time 
clouds, and therefore the algorithm performs better than that used in SH98. The empirical 
relationship developed by Shahi et al [2010], however, was developed for a single buoy location, 
and is not valid over other locations, particularly over different latitude regions. Shahi et al. [2011] 
further improved the algorithm to make it valid over a wide Indian Ocean region by including the 
solar zenith angle in the empirical formulations. The detailed formulation is given in the following 
section. 
6.4. Formulation of the SWR Algorithm 
The improved algorithm developed at Space Applications Centre (SAC) to compute the SWR from 
OLR observations from geostationary satellites is described in detail by Shahi et al. [2011]. The 
methodology was developed using a large collocated dataset of the spatially well distributed (in 
latitude) buoy measured SWR and the half-hourly estimates of OLR from geostationary satellite 
observations over Indian Ocean region. The generalization of the empirical relationship has been 
achieved by normalizing the SWR values to nadir locations by making use of the solar zenith angle 
information. 
The in-situ SWR is the down-welling shortwave radiation measured by the Research Moored Array 
for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy. Daily average 
shortwave radiation is computed as a 24 hour average. Fig.1 shows the locations of the 13 RAMA 
buoys in the warm pool region of Indian Ocean used for the algorithm development for the period 
of 2002-2009. The OLR products have been obtained from EUMETSAT for the Indian Ocean 
coverage of the Meteosat-5 (sub-satellite point at 57E) upto December 2006 and Meteosat-7 (sub-
satellite point at 63E) beyond January 2007. Meteosat derived OLR was estimated from the half-
hourly observations in the thermal infrared (TIR, 10.5-12.5m) and water vapor absorption (WV, 
5.7-7.1m) channels at spatial resolution of 5 km, using the algorithm developed by Schmetz and 
Liu [1988]. The accuracy of geostationary satellite derived OLR is shown to be ~3 W m-2 [Schmetz 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 80 

and Liu, 1988; Singh et al., 2007] using radiative transfer model based simulation studies. The 
validation of geostationary satellite derived OLR with the broadband OLR observations from the 
Clouds and Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) onboard polar orbiting satellites TRMM and 
EOS-Terra reveal the accuracy to be ~7 W m-2 at a daily time-scale [Ba et al., 2003]. 
A collocated dataset of daily averaged SWR (24-hr average) using buoy data and daytime averaged 
OLR (duration of sunshine) was generated for each of the buoy locations. The daytime averaged 
OLR is obtained using average of the half-hourly observations between sunrise to sunset (computed 
using solar zenith angle less than 80o). A training dataset, using collocated observations from each 
of the buoys that represent complete annual cycle, was created for the algorithm development and 
the remaining data treated as the independent testing dataset. 
SAC-Algorithm [Shahi et al., 2011] o used the normalized SWR w.r.t. the nadir viewing angle, i.e. 
SWR sec2(), in the empirical formulation, where is solar zenith angle at local noon. The 
polynomial least square equation between normalized SWR and OLR was found to be: 
 (SWR) sec2() = -0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) 220.75 
which provides the final expression for computing the SWR as: 
SWR = cos2() [-0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) 220.75] 

Figure 1: Locations of RAMA buoys in Indian Ocean overlaid on a sample Meteosat 
OLR coverage

 81 

The improved algorithm is referred as SAC-SWR Algorithm. The root-mean-squared-error 
(RMSE) computed for SAC-SWR estimates from the buoy observations was found to be ~28 W 
m-2 in the testing dataset in contrast to the ~39 W m-2 obtained using SH98. 
The SAC-SWR algorithm was also compared with other datasets for the year 2007 available from: 
(i) Global Energy and Water-Cycle Experiment Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB) project 
of NASA World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), (ii) International Satellite Cloud 
Climatology Project Surface Radiative Flux Dataset (ISCCP-FD), and (iii) National Center for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) analysis. The Spatial resolution of GEWEX-SRB, ISCCP-FD 
and NCEP SWR products are 1, 2.8 and 1.875, respectively. The RMSE computed for different 
SWR products from buoy SWR shows that RMSE for SAC-SWR is lowest for the entire range of 
SWR values, indicating that the accuracy of the SAC-SWR is best under all sky conditions 
followed closely by GEWEX-SWR. 
For combined dataset RMSE for SAC-SWR is 27.3 W m-2, which is the smallest, followed by 
32.7, 37.5 and 59.6 W m-2, respectively, for GEWEX, ISCCP and NCEP SWR products. The 
estimate of the standard error on weekly time scales is much smaller than that on daily time 
scales, with values of 11.8, 13.4, 15.3, and 32.8 Wm2 for SAC, GEWEX, ISCCP, and NCEP 
products, respectively.

We show below a schematic diagram of the SWR algorithm training and retrievals. 

6.6. Operational Implementation 
Following steps are used to compute daily average SWR: 
 Half-hourly OLR data from Indian GEO Satellites is acquired for a given day. 
 For each observation, solar zenith is computed to ascertain the solar illumination conditions 
i.e. to get information about local time. 
 From half-hourly OLR data, the daytime averaged OLR (OLRdayavg) is computed at every 
pixel by restricting the solar zenith angle () to less than 80 at each pixel during averaging. 
 Solar zenith angle at local noon () is computed at each pixel location corresponding to the 
given day of observation. (In bullet 2, also solar zenith is computed) 
 Using land/sea flag information, the daily averaged Surface Shortwave Radiation 
(SWRdayavg) is computed over Indian ocean region from the empirical relationship 
developed at SAC:

7.2. Background 
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models has become an indispensable tool for providing 
weather forecast. These models are immensely benefited from various in-situ and satellite 
observations. These observations are used for correcting model forecast trajectories, model output 
validation and model parameter tuning. Ingestion of various observations has now become a state-
of-art and also rapidly growing to meet the challenges posed by huge amount of available 
observations. With the advancement and maturing of data assimilation (DA) techniques direct 
satellite observed radiance (or brightness temperatures) are operationally assimilated by various 
operational agencies. Assimilation of satellite observed radiances can be primarily subdivided into 
two classes: assimilation of clear sky brightness temperature and assimilation of all sky (clear and 
cloudy both) observation. Though, cloudy regions probably have a large impact on the accuracy 
of the NWP model predictions (McNally 2002; Kumar et al. 2014), but the direct assimilation of 
cloudy radiances is still beyond the scope of existing global NWP systems (Pavelin et al. 2008). This 
is due to the fact, that assimilation of cloudy radiances requires an observation operator having 
realistic representation of cloud effects, and a NWP model capable of accurately representing 
cloud at same scales (Chevallier et al. 2004). Such kind of capabilities of existing NWP model is in 
development phase and fast radiative transfer (RT) model have large uncertainties over cloudy 
regions, and have complex nonlinearity in assimilation when clouds exist (Bauer et al. 2011). 
Therefore, cloudy infrared (IR) radiance is still part of ongoing research and development activities 
and is not the part of operational assimilation system. Nevertheless, the method of assimilation of 
clear sky brightness temperature (satellite observation which are not affected by the presence of 
clouds) has already reached to matured stage, therefore, used operationally in providing weather 
forecast. Thus clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) is a very important parameter from the 
NWP data assimilation applications. clear sky radiance assimilation has become the indispensable 
part of assimilation system. For clear sky radiance assimilation, it is essential to eliminate the 
cloudy pixels in order to retain only clear-sky radiances only. Usually a binary mask (clear/cloudy)

and Eresmaa (2014) found that if cloudy radiances are assimilated as clear radiances, the quality 
of the NWP analysis/prediction impacted negatively. 
7.3. Objective 
The main objective of this document is to provide the theoretical basis for calculating clear sky 
brightness temperature (CSBT) for INSAT-3D/3DR TIR-1 and water vapor channels. The proposed 
algorithm will be applied to estimate CSBT over 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR) along with 
statistical parameters and a confidence flag that will help in using CSBT value in DA process. 
CSBT product is calculated for only clear pixels identified by INSAT-3D/3DR imager cloud mask 
(CMK) product. The algorithm has no limitation based on geographical location, therefore, can be 
applied to generate products over full disk or sector products. Nevertheless, the CSBT product is 
generated from only full disk product.

7.5.1. Overview 
The clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is intended to be 
generated at 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR). CSBT product is generated at much coarser resolution 
than the actual resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at nominal 
resolution of ~4 km at nadir for TIR-1, TIR-2, MIR and ~8 km for water vapor. The gridding 
(averaging) over all pixels within 0.50x0.50 FOR. This averaging is done to enhance the signal to

noise ratio and to make observation less correlated. Data assimilation warrants very accurate, and 
uncorrelated observations. CSBT product is aimed towards providing observations. 
7.5.2. Generation of CSBT 
As it is evident from the name of parameter, CSBT is generated for clear sky pixels. Since this 
product is mainly used in NWP data assimilation, it is re-gridded at coarser resolution of 0.50x0.50 
grid. This helps in reducing noise in value in BT as well as creating uncorrelated observations. 
Generation of CSBT involves following steps: 
7.5.3. Preparation of latitude-longitude grid 
INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are orbiting in geostationary orbit and are located at 83.0 0E and 74 
0E, respectively. Therefore, the geographical extent of observed area by both the satellites is 
different particularly in east-west direction. As both the satellites are in geostationary orbit, thus in 
principle, the viewing location of each pixel does not vary for different acquisitions. Based on the 
fixed grid of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, a latitude-longitude equal grid is selected and all further 
processing in done the same grid. 
For INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: 
Min Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325 
Min Longitude = 1.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325 
For INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: 
Min Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325 
Min Longitude = -3.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325 
7.5.4. Averaging of parameters 
A simple box average method is adopted to generate parameters. CSBT, satellite zenith angle and 
solar zenith angle and land fraction (for a given grid) are generated. In data assimilation, satellite 
and solar zenith angles and land fraction are required along with CSBT. As already stated that 
CSBT is calculated for clear pixels only, therefore, for averaging operational cloud mask product 
is also used. INSAT-3D/3DR operational cloud mask product provides a flag which has one of the 
four values 0,1,2 and 3. 0 indicates clear pixel, 1 indicates cloudy pixel, 3 is representative of 
probably clear pixel and 3 indicates probably cloudy pixel. While calculating average of 
aforementioned parameters, the total of pixels (N), clear pixels (N1) and probably clear pixels (N2) 
within a given grid are also counted. These counts (N, N1 and N2) determine whether CSBT 
product will be computed for a given grid or not. A dynamic threshold which is 10% of total count 
value N is taken. If total number of clear and probable clear pixels (N1+N2) is less than the 
threshold value and CSBT and other products are not generated, but if this is greater than the 
threshold value then it is checked if N1 is also greater then threshold or not. However, in both the 
cases CSBT and other parameters are computed but if N1 is less than the threshold then quality 
flag of CSBT is termed as not very good quality. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 89 

In addition to the average of parameters, standard deviation of BT for a given box is also computed. 
This standard deviation is also provided along with CSBT values to help in deciding the spread of 
BT value for a given box. More standard deviation may help in flagging out some of the CSBT 
value as it may have some contamination of cloud (or cloud edges) 
7.5.5. Quality indicators 
As it is already discussed in previous section that a flag and standard deviation values are generated 
along with CSBT product to provide user an indication of quality of CSBT value. The major 
confidence in quality is determined by the number of clear pixels with a grid box, if more than 50% 
of grid is covered by clear pixels then that box is given the highest confidence flag 0, but if this 
number is between 25 to 50% the flag=1 and if it between 10 to 25% then flag=2. 
These various flags are given to user to give them a flexibility in optimizing the number of data 
points in assimilation and the quality of data set.

7.7. Validation 
7.7.1. Data required 
Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager will be carried out by using 
various analysis such as NCMRWF analysis, GFS analysis and various reanalysis such as ERA 
interim reanalysis. These various analysis and reanalysis will be used to generate brightness 
temperatures using RTTOV or CRTM radiative transfer models. The validation cannot be carried 
out for each half-hourly product but validation will be carried out for only synoptic hours. 
For validation at specific time period special launch campaign is needed wherein various 
radiosondes are launched and these soundings could be used in conjunction with radiative transfer 
model for CSBT validation.

8.2. Introduction 
The aim of Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) product is provide area average brightness 
temperatures (Tb) for representing cloud free pixels. These products have been recently developed 
by Space Applications Centre under INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) 
project to be used in radiance assimilation in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The 
high-temporal resolution data of INSAT-3D Sounder (hourly observations) would be extremely 
useful for monitoring and predicting of the fast developing weather systems through 4D-VAR 
radiance assimilation in NP models. 
8.3. Algorithm Description 
The following sections provide details of the procedure for generating CSBT products: 
8.3.1. Cloud detection 
The first step in CSBT product generation is to filter out cloud contaminated pixels from the 
Sounder observations and generate a cloud-flag for each of the pixels. This section provides the 
physical basis for detection of the cloudy pixels from INSAT-3D Sounder observations. The output 
of cloud mask algorithm gives the degree of presence of a cloud in it. This information enables the 
subsequent steps to use this information for further processing. 
The cloud detection algorithm is carried out in three steps. The flow chart is shown in fig.1. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

Fig.1: Flow chart of the Sounder cloud detection algorithm 
The cloud detection methodology for INSAT-3D sounder follows operational GOES sounder cloud 
detection procedure developed by Schreiner et al. (2001). This cloud detection algorithm uses 4 
infrared channels and a visible channel during daytime for cloud detection and 5 infrared channels 
for the detection of nighttime clouds. One additional infrared channel is used to detect clouds 
appearing at dawn time. The various channels used in cloud detection are summarized below: 
Ch#3 - 13.3 m (CO2 absorption, used for detection of thin cirrus) 
Ch#6 - 12.6 m (Moderate WV-absorption, used in detecting some low level inversions) 
Ch#7 - 12.0 m (Weak WV-absorption, used in detecting low clouds and fog) 
Ch#8 - 11.0 m (Longwave Window, used in detecting various level of clouds) 
Ch#17 - 4.0 m (Shortwave Window, used to detect low clouds and fog at night) 
Ch#18 - 3.8 m (Shortwave Window, used to detect low clouds after sunrise) 
Ch#19 - 0.6 m (Visible band used in detecting various level of clouds during daylight) 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 94 

A series of tests are applied using these channels to detect stratus, cirrus (thin and opaque), fog, 
snow and inversion. Here for cloud detection algorithm a 3x3 pixel field-of-regard (FOR) is used. 
The FOR is moved by 1 pixel sequentially in E-W and N-S (along and across the scan-line) to 
maximize the clear FOR detection. Two types of cloud flags are generated one each for the FOV 
(single pixel) and FOR (3 x 3 pixel box). In present algorithm the output contains three types of 
cloud-flags that are given by: 
0: Clear 
1: Cloudy 
2: Partially cloudy 
The cloud detection procedure is carried out in three steps to filters out cloudy pixels very 
accurately and efficiently: 
(a). The first step is a very gross check and is applied on a FOR of 3x3 pixel box. If it fails in the 
first check then the whole FOR is declared as cloudy and it moves to the next FOR. In case of 
passing the first step a series of tests are applied on the FOR in second step. In third and final step, 
a series of tests are applied on each FOV and the results of these tests decide the final outcome. 
(b). Primary Array Flag (PAF): This is first step of cloud detection to generate the primary array 
flag. Four tests are applied on a FOR to generate PAF. Generation of PAF requires computation of 
two thresholds Tmax and Tmin from ancillary information. Tmax and Tmin are computed using surface 
skin temperature information which is available either through AWS or from model forecast. Here 
model forecast is used for surface skin temperature. 
Tmax= TS + 20, and Tmin= TS - 20 
Where, TS is the surface skin temperature. After this calculation the following checks are applied: 
1) Visible reflectance of the warmest pixel in FOR computed from Ch#8 (11m) must be less than 
a certain threshold value. The value of threshold for visible channel over land is 25% and over 
water is 7%. The value of threshold may vary for low surface temperature and low sun angles. If 
the surface skin temperature is less than 273K the threshold value over land is increased by a factor 
of 1.5. Similarly, to take care of low sun angles the land limit is multiplied by solar zenith angle. 
This test is possible only for day time. 
2) The Ch#8 Tb (11m) of warmest pixel must be less than Tmax and must be greater than Tmin. 
3) Inversion test is applied on the difference of maximum Ch#8 Tb (11m) and maximum Ch#18 
Tb (3.8 m) within FOR. This test is applicable only during night time. For this test a threshold 
(Th1) is calculated using an empirical relation using the NET value of Ch#8 and Ch#18. 
Difference between the warmest pixel of Ch#18 and the warmest pixel of Ch#8 must be greater 
than the Th1 for a pixel to be clear. 
If any of these tests fail, then the whole box is assumed to be cloudy and not processed further, 
otherwise it will proceed for secondary array flag (SAF) procedure. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 95 

(c). Secondary Array Flag (SAF): The first step of SAF is to compute skin temperature 
empirically using three channels, Ch#8 (Tb8), Ch#7 (Tb7) and Ch#18 (Tb18) and two channels Ch#8 
(11m) and Ch#7 (12m). These empirical relations for skin temperature are as follows: 
TS3 = a0 + a1*Tb8 + a2* Tb7 + a3* Tb18 (using 3 channels) 
TS2 = b0 + b1* Tb8 + a2* Tb7 

 (using 2 channels) 
These coefficients are pre-determined from a large simulated matchup dataset. The standard tests 
for SAF are following: 
 The difference between TS3 and TS2 must not be greater than 2K. 
 The cold sea test only over ocean and this test fail if the highest Tb8 in FOR FOV is less 
than 270K. 
 The reflected sunglint test checks the difference between brightness temperatures for the 
highest Tb8 and Tb18. The difference must be less than 10K. 
If any of these SAF test is fail then the whole FOR is assigned as cloudy. Otherwise clear flag is 
assigned to whole FOR. SAF is followed by final and Individual FOV Flag (IFF). In IFF series of 
tests are applied to individual FOV of a given box. 
(d). Individual FOV Flag (IFF): 
Snow test: This test is daytime test and discriminates between snow and cloud. If visible 
reflectance of FOV is greater than the minimum reflectance (already defined in PAF) and skin 
temperature is greater than a threshold (275K) then FOV is cloudy otherwise clear. Threshold in 
this case can be adjusted to any value in the range of 273 to 285 K. 
Secondary stratus test: In this test difference of moisture corrected Tb7 and Tb8 is compared with 
a threshold. The threshold depends on Tb7 and difference of skin temperature (Ts) and surface air 
temperature (Ta), both from forecast. 
Th2 = max[ NET(Ch7), 0.25*(Ta-Ts)], here Ts is calculated using 2 or 3 channels depending on 
daytime and nighttime situation. 
TPW=max(Tb8) max(Tb7), in 3x3 pixel FOR 
Tb7(corrected) = Tb7 + TPW 
Cirrus test: If the Tb5 of FOV under consideration is less than the value of noise corrected Tb5 
value corresponding to FOV having maximum Tb8 in the given FOR, then the test is said to be 
failed. 
Tb5(Noise corrected) = {Tb5 corresponding to max(Tb8)} - 7.0*NET(Ch#5) 
Final skin temperature test: 
[Tb8 + {Tb8 Tb7}@max(Tb7)] < Ts, then test is assumed to be fail. 
If one FOV passes all the tests then that FOV is upgraded to clear. If FOV fails any of the tests then 
it is flagged as cloudy or partially cloudy depending on the SAF flag.

8.3.2. Clear-Sky Brightness Temperature computation 
The CSBT product at for pixel is computed as average of the clear-sky pixel brightness 
temperatures in the 3x3 FOR centered at the pixel location, if at least 3 clear pixels are found in 
the FOR. The averaging reduces the impact due to the uncertainty in cloud-detection algorithm as 
well as reduces the random noise of measurements (NET) over individual pixels. The land/sea 
flag as well as the clear fraction in the FOR is also computed. Fig.1 shows a sample of the INSAT-
3D sounder brightness temperatures and corresponding CSBT of each of the channels for 24 
November 2014 14:00 GMT.

8.5. Validation 
Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR Sounder will be carried out using 
various analyses, such as NCMRWF, GFS, ECMWF analysis etc. These analyses will be used to 
generate brightness temperatures using PFAAST/RTTOV/CRTM radiative transfer models. The 
validation cannot be carried out for each half-hourly product but validation will be carried out for 
only synoptic hours. 
For validation at specific time-period special launch campaign will be carried out where high 
quality radiosondes are launched and these soundings would be used with radiative transfer model 
for CSBT validation. 
 Apart from this inter-satellite comparison will be carried out using CSBT products from 
hyperspectral sounder observation collocated with INSAT-3D/3DR Sounder and convolving with 
the SRFs.

9.2. Background 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud properties such as 
cloud top temperature, cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount from two INSAT-3D thermal 
infrared window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5-12.5 m) and water vapor (6.7 m) channels. 
This document also describes the validation procedure. In this document some background and the 
methodology employed to derive the cloud top temperature/pressure and effective cloud amount is 
discussed. It mainly discusses the theoretical basis and practical aspects of the retrieval algorithm 
for cloud parameters from INSAT-3D imager channels and outlines the intended validation 
approach with validation results. 
The cloud properties such as cloud cover, cloud height etc. are very important for various climate 
and weather applications. The clouds at different heights affects weather and climate phenomenon 
in different ways. It is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. 
Clouds do not only add beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of 
atmospheric activities. Clouds vary in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, 
therefore, different clouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing 
cumulus clouds are precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature 
inversion results in fog. Thin cirrus clouds do not play a critical role in short to medium range 
weather activities, but they play a very crucial role in earths heat budget and also helps in tracking 
upper level winds. Thin cirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass 
through it but doesnt allow outgoing infrared radiation, thus increases the radiative energy and 
eventually leads to the warming of earth-atmosphere system. 
Cirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the Earth; 
they allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate changes will

have to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the Earth's heat 
budget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation 
have been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 m) radiances observed 
from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; Gruber and Chen, 1988). 
The occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in these single channel 
approaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect cirrus in global 
(Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and Menzel, 1989) cloud 
studies. 
Additionally, clouds are very important to study weather phenomena at various spatial and temporal 
scales including its diurnal cycle. Diurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative 
exchange, precipitation, small and large-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly 
linked with clouds, therefore, underlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and 
Cox (1981) had reported the diurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal 
oscillations are part of dynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial 
scales. (Foltz and Gray, 1979) 
9.3. Objective 
The main objective of this document is to provide the theoretical basis for deriving cloud top 
pressure/ cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR imager channels. 
The proposed algorithm will be applied to retrieve cloud properties from imager channels over 
each pixel defined as confidently cloudy from CMK product. The algorithm has no limitation based 
on geographical location, therefore, can be applied to generate products over full disk or sector 
products.

9.5. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
9.5.1. Overview 
The cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is 
intended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at coarser 
resolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at 
nominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir. The averaging over a Field of Regard (FOR) of 9x9 pixels 
is used to enhance the signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels 
is higher in comparison to clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed 
radiances/brightness temperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties. 
For each 9x9 pixel box cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount is 
retrieved using Infrared window channel method or water vapor - window intercept method. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 103 

Generally, window method does not give accurate retrievals over semi-transparent thin high clouds, 
therefore, water vapor - window intercept method is used over those FOR. 
9.5.2. Infrared Window Channel (WIN) method 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either 
infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast 
temperature profiles. However, for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager at present only Infrared window 
observations are used in this method. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud 
temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at 
the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction 
(NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works 
well with opaque clouds. 
9.5.3. Water VaporInfrared Window Intercept Method (H2O) 
Cloud top pressure derived with this method are based on the fact that radiances from two different 
spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of regard at a 
specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud 
radiances.

 is the opaque ("black") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the 
fractional transmittance for radiation in spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric layer at 
pressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOR covered with cloud, 
Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud top pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the 
spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the 
radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p. 
This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature 
and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the 
observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model 
guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In 
the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each Field of Regard (FOR) are plotted with the 
calculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The 
straight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximates the 
observed surface and cloud conditions.

 104 

Fig 1: Measured radiances (mW m2 sr1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al., 
1993) 
By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one 
(representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster 
determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram 
analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and it involves ten steps. These steps are outlined 
in detail in Nieman et al. (1993) and Nieman et al. (1997). Calculated water vapor radiances can 
be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated 
radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated 
radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the 
above equation (2). When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no 
adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud 
contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the 
atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, 
leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model 
forecast are used here as the guess fields. 
After retrieving the value of cloud top pressure effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is 
computed using eq (3) 
ABB =
D(E)DFG(E)
H[E,K(LF)]DFG(E) (3) 
where N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, NO the effective cloud amount, is the 
window channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to 
window channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel.

9.5.4. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure 
The value of cloud top height, cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager is derived 
corresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager. These values are 
again derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the 
temperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential 
height formulae is used to compute cloud height for given temperature profile. Geopotential height 
(GPH) is then given by

amount retrieved. For window channel method [\++ = ) 
9.5.6. Radiance bias adjustment 
 It is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily 
dependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and the fast forward RT model. If forward simulations 
are not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in the retrieved products. To make 
observations and forward model simulations consistent, a radiance bias adjustment is necessary 
step. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 106 

Radiance bias adjustment is carried out by using previous eight days of good quality matchup data 
of INSAT-3D/3DR Imager clear-sky observations and spatially and temporally collocated 
simulated INSAT-3D/3DR Imager radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS 
analysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky 
observations are average over 9x9 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% 
pixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In 
addition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less 
than 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment 
factor in terms of slope and offset.

10.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
It is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. Clouds do not only 
add beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of atmospheric activities. 
Clouds very in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, therefore, different 
clouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing cumulus clouds are 
precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature inversion results in fog. 
Thin cirrus clouds are not very exciting clouds from short to medium range weather activities but 
play a very crucial role in earths heat budget and also helps in tracking upper level winds. Thin 
cirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass through it but doesnt allow 
outgoing infrared radiation thus increase the radiative energy and eventually leads to the warming 
of earth-atmosphere system. 
Cirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the 
Earth; they allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate 
changes will have to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the 
Earth's heat budget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing 
longwave radiation have been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 m) 
radiances observed from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; 
Gruber and Chen, 1988). The occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in 
these single channel approaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect 
cirrus in global (Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and 
Menzel, 1989) cloud studies. 
Clouds are very important to study at various spatial and temporal scale including its diurnal cycle. 
Diurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative exchange, precipitation, small and 
large-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly linked with clouds, therefore, 
underlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and Cox (1981) had reported the 
diurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal oscillations are part of 
dynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial scales (Foltz and Gray, 
1979). 
The cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder 
is intended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at 
coarser resolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations which are 
available at nominal resolution of ~10 km at nadir. The averaging of 5x5 pixels will enhance the 
signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels is higher in comparison 
to clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed radiances/brightness 
temperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties. 
Cloud properties from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations are very important parameters to 
study diurnal, seasonal or annual variations in cloud cover as these parameters are available at high 
temporal resolution at the same geographical location. These parameters could also help in

segregating semi-transparent transmissive clouds (partially transparent to terrestrial radiation) 
opaque clouds in the analysis of cloud cover (Wylie and Menzel, 1989). Similar kind of studies 
are already carried out by Wylie et al. (1994) using NOAA-HIRS observations. 
10.5. Algorithm Theoretical Description 
This section presents the theoretical basis of the algorithm and practical considerations. Retrieval 
of cloud products (CTP, CTT and effective cloud amount) is a combination of two methods: 
Window channel method and CO2 slicing method. Both of these methods require forecast fields of 
temperature and moisture. The CO2 slicing method requires the use of radiative transfer model. 
In this section physics of deriving cloud height and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR 
sounder observations is discussed. This sections presents the conceptual framework of retrieval 
algorithm. 
10.6. Physical Basis of the Cloud Top Pressure/Temperature/Height 
Algorithm 
10.6.1. CO2 Slicing: Mid- to High-Level Clouds 
The assumptions made for the application of the CO2 -slicing algorithm are (Menzel et al., 1992): 
(i) 
the emissivity of the cloud is the same in all channels used, 
(ii) 
clouds occur as a single cloud layer, 
(iii) 
lower cloud layers are ignored, and 
(iv) 
the surface temperature and the temperature structure of the atmosphere and its 
transmittance at the used wavelengths are known. 
Retrieval of cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount (i.e., cloud fraction multiplied by cloud 
emittance) are performed using radiances measured in those spectral bands that are located within 
the broad 15 m CO2 absorption region. The CO2 slicing technique makes use of combination of 
15 m CO2 absorption channels that have different opacity, therefore, sensing different layer of 
atmosphere. This helps in assigning height of clouds. The channels of INSAT-3D/3DR used in the 
cloud top pressure and amount algorithm are described in Table 1.

The CO2 slicing method is a well-established method and is extensively used for deriving cloud 
properties from a wide range of GEO and LEO satellite observations. Keeping this fact in mind 
the latest series of GOES-12/13/14 had a CO2 channel instead of the split window thermal IR 
channel. This method is used for deriving cloud top pressure and temperatures from VISSR 
Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) (Menzel and Strabala 1989; Menzel et. al 1992) observations, High 
resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) (Wylie and Menzel 1999) observations, 
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Plantick et al. 2003; Menzel et al. 
2008) radiances and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sounder 
(Menzel et al. 1992; Menzel and Purdom 1994) observations. Several sensitivity studies such as 
Menzel et al. (1992) and Baum and Wielicki (1994) have already been carried out to quantify errors 
arising from different sources. 
The CO2 slicing technique can be understood by calculating the radiances using radiative transfer 
models in an atmosphere with a single cloud layer. For a given cloud element in a field of view 
(FOV), i.e. a single sounder pixel, the radiance observed, R(), in spectral band , can be written 
as: 
U(Q) = NUTV_ + (1 N)UTVW ------------------- (1) 
Where U(Q) is observed radiance in band , N is the fractional cloud coverage, UTVW is radiance 
from clear portion and UTV_ is radiance from the cloud covered portion. 
Cloud covered radiance can be written as: 
UTV_ = OUab + (1 O)UTVW ------------------- (2) 
Where O is the emissivity of cloud and Uab is radiance from the opaque cloud. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 114 

By combining Eq (1) and Eq (2) we get: 
U(Q) = (1 NO)UTVW(Q) + NOUab(Q) ------------------- (3) 
Now from radiative transfer equation UTV_ and UTVW are given as: 
UTV_ = P(S)c(S) 
c(Q, d)
_H[E,K(b)]
_b
Le
f
gd ------------------- (4) 
UTVW = P(S)c(S) 
c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)]
_b
Lh
f
gd ------------------- (5) 
Where S is the surface pressure, S is pressure corresponding to the top of single level cloud, 
c(Q, d) is the top of the atmosphere (p = 0) transmittance of radiation of spectral band emitted 
from the atmospheric level at pressure p, and P[Q, R(d)] is the Planck radiance for spectral band 
for temperature T at pressure level p. Thus first terms of Eq (4) and (5) represents the contribution 
to radiance from the surface term (which is cloud top in Eq (4) and surface in Eq(5)), whereas, the 
second term represents the absorption of radiation by atmosphere above the surface or cloud top. 
These equations neglect the scattering by clouds or atmosphere which is very valid assumptions 
for clear atmosphere and opaque clouds at the desired sounder spectral bands. 
Now expanding above equations by integrating by parts and solving we get: 
Uab(Q, ST) = UTVW(Q) 
c(Q, d)
_H[E,K(b)]
_b
Lh

gd ------------------- (6) 
Now by substituting Eq (6) in Eq (3) we get: 
U(Q) UTVW(Q) = NO 
c(Q, d)
_H[E,K(b)]
_b
Le
Lh
gd ------------------- (7) 
This is the basic equation used in CO2 slicing method. It is evident from the Eq (7) that with the 
help of a-priori information of UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d), value of S that is cloud top pressure could be 
inferred. However, even with this a-priori information, there are two unknowns (NO and S) in Eq 
(7). To solve this problem, the ratio of Eq (7) for two observations made in nearby spectral bands 
is taken. Thus radiance ratios between two spectral bands in similar frequencies (Chahine, 1974; 
Smith and Platt, 1978) gives the information of cloud top pressure. 
The ratio of the deviations in observed radiances, R() to their corresponding clear-sky radiances, 
UTVW(Q) for two spectral bands of frequency Q and Q viewing the same FOV is written as 
D(Ei)DFGj(Ei)
D(Ek)DFGj(Ek) =

As it is already stated that channels with wavenumber (or wavelength) that are very similar in 
wavenumber (wavelength) are taken to satisfy the assumption that cloud emissivities in both 
channels are same that is O is approximately equal to O. With this assumption we are left with 
only one unknown in Eq (8) and that can be easily estimated. 
After retrieving the value of cloud top pressure using a-priori information of UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d) 
in eq (8), effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is computed using eq (9) 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 115 

NO =
D(E)DFGj(E)
H[E,K(LF)]DFGj(E) ------------------- (9) 
where N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, NO the effective cloud amount, is the 
window channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to 
window channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel. 
It is evident from the equation (9) that effective cloud amount or effective cloud emissivity is 
multiplication of N (fractional cloud cover within the FOV) and (Cloud emissivity), therefore, 
effective cloud amount can be less than 1 because of: 
broken cloud (N<1, =1) has filled the FOV 
overcast transmissive cloud (N=1, <1) 
broken transmissive cloud (N<1, <1) 
Therefore, it is difficult to quantify exactly the emissivity of clouds using the effective cloud 
amounts from approximately 50 km x 50 km INSAT-3D/3DR sounder products. 
The cloud top products from CO2 slicing technique are matched with other methods to filter out 
any other clouds that are not upper level clouds. Upper level clouds are flagged by using the 
combination of highly absorbing channels (such as water vapor absorption channel in 6.7 m or 
CO2 absorption channel in 15 m band) and channels with less absorption. In general, the 
brightness temperatures in strong absorption channels are much cooler than the brightness 
temperatures (BT) in weak absorption channels for clear atmospheric condition or low level 
clouds. Contrary to this, for high level clouds BT in strong absorption channel is warmer than the 
weak absorption channels (Soden and Bretherton, 1993; Schmetz et al., 1997). Appropriate 
thresholds were taken to identify the high level clouds in INSAT-3D/3DR cloud top retrieval 
algorithm. In present algorithm 14.03 m (channel 3) and 13.33 m (channel 5) of INSAT-3D/3DR 
sounder are used for this purpose. If BT of ch#3 is greater than the BT of ch#5 by a given threshold, 
then the cloud is assumed to be high cloud and cloud top pressure from CO2 slicing method is 
retained. 
Equation (8) is used to retrieve cloud top pressure for a 5 x 5 FOR. The left side of Equation (8) 
contains the terms for observed radiances as well as clear radiances. The value of observed 
radiances is calculated by taking the average of cloudy pixels within 5x5 FOR. Cloud top 
computation is carried out only if 16 or more cloudy pixels are found within 5x5 box. Computation 
of clear sky radiances and transmittances is carried out using a fast forward radiative transfer model 
called RTTOV (Eyre 1991; Saunders et al. 1999; Matricardi et al 2001) developed at European 
Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). RTTOV uses the Pressure Layer 
Optical Depth algorithm (Hannon et al 1996). This model is very flexible and can take any number 
of pressure levels for forward model computation, however, internally it interpolates atmospheric 
profiles to fixed 43 pressure levels ranging from 1013 to 0.1 hPa. This interpolation is done because 
fast forward coefficients for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder SRFs are derived on given 43 pressure 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 116 

levels. The forward calculations from RTTOV takes satellite zenith angle, absorption by well-
mixed gases (including nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide), water vapor (including the water 
vapor continuum), and ozone into account. The forecast field from NCEP containing temperature, 
moisture profiles, surface air temperature, skin temperature etc. are used to simulate clear sky 
transmittances and radiances. 
The right hand side of Equation (8) uses aforementioned transmittance profiles. Integration is 
carried out by using trapzoidal method wherein integration limit is bounded by surface pressure 
and tropopause pressure level. 
For the retrieval of cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder a top-down approach, 
similar to MODIS cloud top pressure retrieval method is followed. In this approach pair of two 
channels are selected based on their decreasing opacity. If retrieval of cloud top pressure is 
successful for a given pair, then there will no need for applying eq (8) for other pair of channels 
which are relatively less opaque. For INSAT-3D/3DR sounder first pair of ch#2 and ch#3 are taken 
which are considered to be the most opaque channels for CO2 slicing method. If eq (8) 
appropriately converges for this pair, then retrieval is considered to be successful, otherwise the 
same procedure is repeated with pairs of (ch#3, ch#4) or (ch#4, ch#5). If none of these pairs are 
able to give value of cloud top pressure, then window channel method is used for retrieval of cloud 
top pressure. 
10.6.2. Window Channel method for cloud top pressure for low to mid clouds 
In this method the cloud top pressure is carried out by comparing infrared window channel 
brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. A 6-h NWP 
model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast 
System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile (GFS; Derber et al. 1991). This method assumes 
that clouds are overcast and non-transmissive (=1). Generally, cloud top temperatures/pressure 
of low level overcast clouds are determined by using window channel method. In addition to it, 
wherein, cloud top pressure is not determined by CO2 slicing method, window channel method is 
used to retrieve cloud top properties for those pixels too. In this method cloud top pressure is 
determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of BT cloudy pixels in 5x5 
FOR, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. The cloud emissivity is assumed 
to be unity and N=Nc/25. 
Finally, all cloudy FORs are assigned a cloud top pressure either by CO2 slicing or infrared window 
technique. 
10.7. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure 
The value of cloud top height and cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are derived 
corresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder. These values are 
again derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the 
temperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential

10.8. Radiance bias adjustment 
It is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily 
dependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and fast forward RT model. If forward simulations 
are not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in retrieved products. To make 
observations and forward model simulations consistent, radiance bias adjustment is a necessary 
step. 
Radiance bias adjustment is carried out by previous eight days of good quality matchup data of 
INSAT-3D/3DR sounder clear-sky sounder observations and spatially and temporally collocated 
simulated INSAT-3D/3DR sounder radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS 
analysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky 
observations are average over 5x5 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% 
pixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In 
addition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less 
than 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment 
factor in terms of slope and offset.

11.2. Introduction 
In this document, we offer some background to the cloud microphysics retrieval over oceans using 
INSAT-3D imager data, describe the theoretical basis of the cloud microphysics retrieval 
algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm 
implementation, the technical issues and the future scope. 
11.3. Overview and Background 
Clouds are suspension of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. They are of varying sizes and shapes. 
They can be of water, ice or mixed phase. The size of cloud droplets is of the order of 10 m. 
Clouds strongly modulate the Earths energy balance and its atmosphere through their interaction 
with the solar and terrestrial radiation (Roebeling et al., 2005). Their impact on the radiation budget 
can result in a heating or cooling of the planet, depending on the radiative properties of the cloud 
and their altitude (Stephens et al., 1981). The radiative properties of the clouds depend upon the 
various cloud microphysical parameters which includes optical depth, effective particle radius, 
thermodynamic phase etc. Clouds interact with radiation in many ways like scattering, emission, 
absorption and this interaction is sensitive towards each of the microphysical parameters. The 
temporal monitoring of cloud-top microphysics is of extreme importance in the precipitation 
development processes. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties like effective radius, 
optical depth, thermodynamic phase etc. from INSAT 3D has been made possible due to the 
inclusion of 1.6 m channel in INSAT 3D imager. This is a major enhancement as compared to 
the derivation of only the cloud top temperature from Kalpana VHRR. Earlier studies show that 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 122 

the simulation of convective systems is very sensitive to the parameterization of cloud 
microphysics. Thus retrieval of the microphysical parameters from INSAT 3D aids in monitoring 
and accurate prediction of convective weather events. The cloud-microphysical parameters at high 
temporal resolution will be very helpful in tracking the evolution of local as well as mesoscale 
systems. 
The sensitivity of different microphysical parameters to different regions of electromagnetic 
spectrum can be studied with the help of a radiative transfer (RT) model. A Radiative transfer 
model (RTM) computes the radiative transfer of the electromagnetic radiation through the 
atmosphere. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties is done with the help of an RT model 
using the imager channels of INSAT-3D. The INSAT-3D channels which may be used for cloud 
properties retrieval includes Visible (0.65m) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR-1.66m). The 
importance of retrieving the optical thickness and effective radius derives not only from the fact 
that such a retrieval is possible, but from the fact that shortwave cloud radiative properties depend 
almost exclusively on these two parameters. 
11.4. Objective 
The main objective of this document is to provide step wise algorithm, inputs and outputs as 
expected from the INSAT-3D cloud microphysical product. This document will form the basis of 
operational implementation of the algorithm. 
11.5. Inputs 
Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for Visible 
channel and SWIR along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, 
azimuth angle). 
11.5.1. Static data 
 This will consist of the Look-up Table (LUT) which is generated using a RT model and stored. A 
random dataset of cloud microphysical parameters with solar geometry is also stored as static file. 
These files will be required by the inversion model.

11.6. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
 In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for deriving cloud 
microphysical parameters using INSAT-3D channels. 
11.6.1. Overview 
The underlying principle on which the retrieval of these microphysical parameters is based is the 
fact that the reflection function of clouds in the visible band is primarily a function of the cloud 
optical thickness, whereas the reflection function at a water (or ice) absorbing band in the 
shortwave infrared (SWIR) is primarily a function of cloud particle size. 
11.6.2. Theoretical Background 
The visible (0.7m) channel is a non-absorbing channel; the reflectance depends only upon the 
cloud optical depth. Hence, there is a very significant difference between the radiances of very 
thick clouds and thin clouds in the visible spectrum. The radiance values are higher for very thick 
clouds as compared to thin clouds. This kind of behaviour indicates a pronounced effect of optical 
depth on the visible portion of the spectrum. For the SWIR bands, the droplet absorption increases 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 124 

approximately linearly with effective radius, and hence the asymptotic reflectance of a cloud 
decreases with increasing particle size. Thus the visible band contains information primarily 
regarding cloud optical thickness, whereas the absorbing bands eventually reach an optical 
thickness where they are primarily dependent on particle size alone. A combination of visible and 
shortwave-infrared absorbing bands therefore provides information on both optical thickness and 
effective radius. 
11.6.3. Algorithm Overview 
To retrieve the cloud optical thickness (c) and effective particle radius (re), a radiative transfer 
model was first used to compute the reflected intensity field. The values of the reflection function 
were stored for different combinations of cloud optical thickness and particle size at three 
geometrical angles in the form of a look-up-table. The determination of optical thickness and cloud 
effective radius from spectral reflectance measurements constitutes the inverse problem. This has 
been solved by comparing the measured reflectances of INSAT-3D visible and SWIR channels 
with entries in the lookup table (LUT) and searching for the combination of c and re that gives the 
best fit. 
In the present case, we have used SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative 
transfer) radiative transfer model for computing the LUT. SBADART computes plane parallel 
radiative transfer in clear and homogeneous cloudy conditions within the Earths atmosphere for 
the region from 0-50,000 st (Ricchiazzi et al.,1998). SBDART can compute the radiative 
effects of several lower and upper atmosphere aerosol types. The radiative transfer equation is 
numerically integrated with DISORT. This module was designed to treat the plane parallel 
radiative transfer. The discrete ordinate method provides a stable algorithm to calculate the plane 
parallel radiative transfer equation in vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. SBDART contains 
pre-computed scattering parameters for the effective radii in the 2-128m range. In order to 
compute the radiative transfer through the cirrus clouds, it also includes scattering parameters of 
spherical ice grains for single size distribution. SBDART computes intensity of scattered and 
thermally emitted radiation at different heights. It allows up to 50 atmospheric layers and 20 
radiation streams. 
The determination of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radius from spectral reflectance 
measurements constitutes the inverse problem and is typically solved by comparing the measured 
reflectances with entries in a lookup table and searching for the combination of c and re that gives 
the best fit (Twomey and Cocks 1982, 1989).

11.7. Operational retrieval implementation 
The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: 
a) Generation of random values within range of solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud optical depth, 
cloud effective radius 
b) Running of RT model for the random vectors and range of satellite zenith (satzen) and 
azimuth angles (satazi) to generate LUT for visible and swir channel 
c) The input random vectors and corresponding LUT is stored. 
d) Steps (1-3) are offline processes. 
e) In online algo, pixel wise value of swir radiance , vis radiance, SZA, satzen, satazi are 
taken as input. Using land-sea mask, only oceanic geo-type pixels are chosen. 
f) A triple vector search is performed in input fields of LUT to find closest sun satellite 
geometry. 
g) The corresponding simulated radiances in visible and swir channels is compared with 
observed radiance from INSAT-3D for cloudy pixels to get the best match, and 
corresponding values of COD and CER are assigned to that pixel.

11.10. Limitations 

Only daytime detection is possible. 

Multi-level clouds can be a major source of error. 

In case of thin clouds or highly inhomogeneous clouds , there may be inaccuracy. 

Other sources of errors will include cloud water vapour absorption, inaccuracy in cloud top 
height assumptions, drizzle in cloud. 
11.11. Future work 

To test the current algorithm for 1-km resolution sector VIS-SWIR radiance product 
(currently not operational). 

With support from IMD, NCMRWF, validation will also be carried from in-situ, aircraft 
campaigns and earlier campaign data from IITM. However, issues arising out of the 
dynamic nature of clouds and their sampling from different platforms can result in non-
converging results.

5-DAY AMV Composite Maps 
At following layers: 
1. High-Level (100-400 hPa) 
2. Mid-Level (401-700 hPa) 
3. Low-Level (701-950 hPa) 

12.2. Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present the methodology for deriving 5-day composite maps 
using Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D/3DR at different broad atmospheric 
levels. The out of six imager channels in INSAT-3D/3DR, AMVs are derived using four channels 
and they are: i) Visible (VIS) covering [0.55 0.75 m], ii) Mid-wave Infrared (MIR) covering 
[3.8 4.0m], iii) Water Vapor (WV) covering [6.5 7.1 m] and iv) Thermal Infrared (TIR1) 
covering [10.2 11.3 m] ranges of spectrum respectively. In this document some background 
and general characteristic of different AMV-derived products; the methodology employed to 
derive the 5-day composite maps are presented. 
12.3. Overview and background 
The Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived by considering the movement of cloud and 
water vapour tracers in successive images of geostationary satellites (Nieman et al., 1997; Velden 
et al., 1997; Schmetz et al., 1993; Kishtawal et al. 2009) are considered as one of the most reliable 
source of wind information with higher spatial-temporal coverage over the ocean as well as land 
regions.The AMVs is one of the important inputs to the global and regional assimilation systems 
for the improvement of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The role of AMVs is particularly 
significant over the oceans and high latitudes where in-situ observations are scarce. The vertical 
coverage of AMVs spreads through high to low-levels as per the channel used during retrieval viz. 
AMV retrieved using: i) infrared channel data covers entire ranges of atmosphere i.e. from 100-
950 hPa, ii) water vapour channel data covers only high-level i.e. from 100-500 hPa, while iii) 
visible and mid-infrared channel data covers low-levels i.e. from 600-950 hPa respectively. 5-Day

composite winds maps derived using the retrieved AMVs in three broad atmospheric levels are 
very useful for monitoring of monsoon flows over Indian region. The following Fig-1 shows an 
example of weekly low-level monsoon flow for the weeks viz. 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July 
2017 respectively. 
Figure-1: Low-level (701 - 950 hPa) weekly monsoon flow derived using visible AMVs for the 
weeks 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July 2017 respectively. 
This type of 5-day composite wind map derived from AMVs can be used to monitor the progress 
of monsoon on operational basis. 
12.4. Objective 
The main objective of this study is to discuss the procedure for deriving the 5-day composite wind 
maps derived using atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) retrieved from INSAT-3D/3DR over 
land and sea at every half-hour interval. The region over which these products will be retrieved is 
same as the domain where AMVs are retrieved i.e. in the region 30-130E, 50S-50N.

12.6. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
12.6.1. Methodology 
To compute 5-day composite of AMV maps for three broad atmospheric levels (high, mid and low-
levels), retrieved scattered AMVs, available at 30-minutes interval, are gridded into 0.5 degree x 
0.5 degree horizontal resolution covering the ares 0E-130E, 50S-50N and by taking 50 hPa vertical 
difference. The vertical pressure levels considered in this case are: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 
400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 hPa respectively. Where-ever AMV is 
not available an undefined value of -999 are assigned to the grid point. Once gridded AMV at 
every 30-minute interval is generated, 5-day composite maps are generated by taking average of 
all available AMVs for a particular grid point. 
i) 
High-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 100 hPa to 400 hPa are averaged for 
5-Day to generate 5-Day composite High-level Map. 
ii) 
Mid-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 401 hPa to 700 hPa are averaged for 
5-Day to generate 5-Day composite mid-level Map. 
iii) Low-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 701 hPa to 950 hPa are averaged for 
5-Day to generated 5-Day composite low-level Map 
12.6.2. Operational Implementation 
Step 1: Extracting 30-minute AMVs from HDF5 file for current acquision time.

13.2. Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving High Resolution Visible 
Winds (HRVIS) from INSAT-3DR imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3DR 
will have one visible channel (0.55 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general 
characteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3DR visible channel 
characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and 
practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 
13.2.1. Overview and background 
Spatiotemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical 
weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of 
geostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed time 
interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the cloud 
mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies and spatio
temporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatiotemporal life cycle includes the generation, 
dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of geostationary satellite 
images. During the 1970s and early 1980s, cloud motion winds were produced in major 
operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service) 
using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early automated techniques supplied 
quality low-level vectors from visible channels but often yielded in consistent quality for mid- and 
high-level motions. Height assignment for the visible winds is done with collocated infrared 
images using infrared window technique. In the subsequent years, due to the developments in 
image-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design 
fully automatic techniques for wind retrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later

13.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
13.4.1. Tracer selection: 
At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud 
features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and 
computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater 
than 15 K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence 
analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are 
generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and 
compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability 
(Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as tracers for cloud-free 
environments. The pixel with maximum bi-directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the 
European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers 
in the Meteosat (first-generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram 
analysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the 
selected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter 
the image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by 
computing local image anomaly in a 24 x 24 template window (in pixel), both in cloudy regions 
of the visible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

 represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the 
mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a 
smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in 
reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).

13.4.2. Height assignment 
The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived 
using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the 
infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final 
height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is 
following: 
(a) Infrared Window Channel (WIN): 
In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either 
infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature 
profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average 
of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP 
model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast 
System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. 
However, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion 
at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. 
(b) Cloud Base Method (BASE): 
Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes 
lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base 
level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed 
at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the 
Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected 
region surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite 
polynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy 
and clear sky region. Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be 
estimated. The mid cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram 
of the cloudy distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 
5% of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same 
distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base 
temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target location. As 
mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those targets which are 
calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude lower than 600 hPa). 
This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous Infrared Window height 
assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for 
water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). 
Once the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the best 
height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of 
all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific visible 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 139 

tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as 
the final height. Once the final height using the above height assignment method is established, 
the pressure height is optimized using minimized differences with first guess winds up to 75 hPa 
in upwards and downwards directions. 
13.4.3. Tracking 
If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers 
are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger search 
window, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, 
the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is 
optimized within 30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 24 X 
24 template (in pixel) in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same 
class as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected. 
The cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images 
in most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two 
successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) 
coefficient (E). It is defined as 

n

t

s
t

I
I

E

(2) 
Where 
tI and 
sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and 
tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 24 x 24 (in pixel) and this is the size 
of template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the 
searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64 (in pixel). The coefficient E is 
normalized to values between and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E = 
0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E< 0 implies the 
lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the 
more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below 
which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) 
is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E 1.0), the 
value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly 
equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the 
best fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the 
possibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences 
between two features compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the 
degree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to 
that of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking

method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean 
region (Deb et al., 2008). 

13.4.4. Wind buffer generation and Quality control 
Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the 
coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the AMVs are 
derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are 
done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through 
3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the 
algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and 
subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer 
is created using previous three images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2 and 2-3) and 
stored in a file (Fig. 1). The previous three images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-
hour decorrelation timescale during retrieval. In quality control procedure consists of a coherence 
analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence 
computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply 
by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. 
Here each vector wind is represented by a complex number

. For every new vector 
under consideration, (from current image-pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed 
at the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show 
similar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

temporal scale t varies from 1 to 3. If all spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors are present, 
then the difference set will contain 27 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 3 temporal scales). 
However, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least 
10 vector differences

, excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in

dif
V
 is arranged in ascending order. The quality 
control process begins is the average of 10 
dif
V
 is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI 
value for each vector is determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are 
performed, which is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A 
weighted average of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality 
vectors from final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of 
rejecting, search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not 
present it goes to next previous times steps and so on. 
If S is the mean speed of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different quality

In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets (i.e. 
in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they dont get support. Hundreds of 
isolated vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current 
method, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method 
produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional 
flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, if we take three satellite images each with 
30-minute interval stating at 02:30 UTC to 03:30 UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair 
are stored as buffer in a file and represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer 
generated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 
UTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For 
example, winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is 
given as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires four 
images. Similarly, the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and 
process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid 
retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 
13.5. Operational Implementation 
Step 1: Tracer selection from image 
 Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly surrounding 
each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the 
window. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 143 

Step 2: Height assignment 
 Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the 
brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with 
collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be 
assigned as initial height. 
 Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique 
mentioned above. 
Step 3: Tracking 
 The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance 
difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. 
This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. 
Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous three images between pairs of images (viz. 
the winds retrieved between 1-2 and 2-3) and stored in a file. The selection of three 
images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region. 
 Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.

13.7.2. Methods of validation 
The evaluation of HRVIS winds should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
Quantitative assessment of the HRVIS winds product is possible from statistical analyses and 
impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated 
radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation 
reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and 
can be employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS 
XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational 
wind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The 
recommended three parts to the report. 
i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite winds 
for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with the 
radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the 
tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. 
ii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor motion 
vectors through the last 12 months. 
 iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.

To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector 
difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS 
guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s 
respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should 
be about zero. 
13.8. Technical Issues (Limitations etc.) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the 
registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However, the 
following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind.However, the retrieved vectors 
in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-
able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 146 

individual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are 
possible by using multi-spectral observations. 
a) Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval 
This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as 
well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the 
retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based 
on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a 
quantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity. 
b) Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment 
We plan to use IMDs operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. 
However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either 
IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution 
based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by 
IMDs regional model. 
c) Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment 
To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the 
optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-
around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of 
RT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of 
cloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. 

d) Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of 
cloud-tracers. 
The comparison has been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the 
efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) 
methods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.

14.2. Introduction 
The geostationary satellite derived winds, also known as Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) are 
considered as one of the most reliable source of wind information over oceanic region where 
normal ground based observations are very rare. Presently in India operationally AMVs are 
available from two advanced meteorological satellites INSAT-3D (Deb et al., 2016, Kishtawal et 
al., 2009) and INSAT-3DR using consecutive 30-minutes images (www.mosdac.gov.in). It is also 
well established that assimilation of AMVs in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model 
leads to significant improvement in the weather forecast (Deb et al, 2010; Kaur et al., 2015; Kumar 
et al. 2016) over the Indian Ocean region. The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm 
for retrieving Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR in 
staggering mode and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D/3DR have two IR window channels 
(10.5-11.5 and 11.5-12.5 ). In this document some background and general characteristic of 
satellite-derived AMV and INSAT-3D/3DR IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed 
to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the 
planned validation approach. 
14.2.1. Overview and background 
The availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic 
and region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated us to re-look further for the improvement 
in retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason 
for this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of 
winds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. For example, 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 151 

if INSAT-3D captured image at 0000 UTC, then INSAT-3DR does at 0015 UTC and similar 
nomenclature follows for other time of the day. The operational meteorological parameters derived 
using INSAT-3DR are same as that of INSAT-3D, with 15 minute time gap. In both the satellites, 
spectrum of the atmosphere is covered by six imager channels i.e. the Visible (VIS), Short-wave 
infrared (SWIR), Mid-wave infrared (MIR), Water vapor (WV) and two split window thermal 
infrared (TIR1 and TIR2) channels. The image registration accuracy significantly improved 
because of star sensors are present on both the satellites. The individual INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR 
AMVs are derived every 30-minute intervals. As an example, the INSAT-3D AMVs are retrieved 
at 0000, 0030, 0100 UTC, while INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived at 0015, 0045, 0115 UTC 
respectively. The AMV derived from these satellites are widely accepted by different national and 
international operational agencies. In the present study, the algorithm for deriving AMVs using 
infrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode is 
demonstrated. Subsequently, this new AMVs generated using staggering mode will bee inter-
compared with individually retrieved INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR AMVs. 
14.2.2. Objective 
The availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic 
and region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated to re-look further for the improvement 
in retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason 
for this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of 
winds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. The main 
objective of this study is to derive the algorithm for retrieving AMVs using infrared and water 
vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode.

14.4.1. Methodology 
The operationally four different spectral channels of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are used to derive 
AMVs over the Indian Ocean region and operational retrieval algorithm is described in Deb et al. 
2016. In the present document, a new staggering algorithm is discussed where data from infrared 
(i.e. TIR1) and water vapor (i.e. WV) channels of both the satellites are used simultaneously for 
higher temporal scale retrieval. Although the major steps of retrieval algorithm (i.e. Tracer

selection, height assignment, tracking and quality control etc) staggering algorithm is same as 
present operational algorithm, however a few changes incorporated in the new algorithm to 
minimize the inaccuracies due to two separate satellite platform is shown in the following Figure 
-1. 

Figure 1: The flowcharts of staggering AMVs retrieval algorithm using INSAT-3D/3DR data 

At first, the satellite ID from which first input image is coming is checked, if it is from INSAT-
3DR, then second image from INSAT-3D is read. In the first image possible cloud tracers are 
identified and each selected tracer is represented by a box of 32 x 32 pixel. The tracer box in the 
first image (i.e. INSAT-3DR) is calibrated with respect to the collocated box in second image (i.e. 
INSAT-3D) using the following formula:

Here, I1 and I2 represent the 32 x 32 (in pixel) tracer boxes from first and second image 
respectively. Var(I1) and Var(I2) represent the variance of the tracer boxes. This is performed to 
reduce the uncertainty in inter-calibration of two different satellites, all-though their sensor 
specifications are exactly same. Then cloud tracers are selected by local image anomaly technique 
in a particular image and subsequently height of the selected tracers is calculated. The height 
assignment component of operational AMV retrieval algorithm uses widely used traditional

 154 

methods viz. the infrared window (WIN) technique, the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 
1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall et. al., 1993). Then selected tracers are tracked in 
larger window in the subsequent image by using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency [Nash and 
Sutcliffe, 1970] coefficient. The detailed description of each step is already discussed in the 
Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) of infrared and water vapor winds from INSAT-
3D or INSAT-3DR (Deb et al. 2008) 

Figure 2: A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval of AMVs in staggering mode for a 
particular time 0500 UTC. 

If the selected first image is from INSAT-3D, the tracers are selected and height assignment is done, 
then before tracking the selected tracers in the second INSAT-3DR image, collocated tracer box in 
INSAT-3DR is calibrated to INSAT-3D equivalent. The process of tracer selection, height 
assignment and tracking is repeated for sixteen pair of images to generate sixteen pairs of raw 
winds which is called as wind buffer. Later, this wind buffer is used for quality control of AMVs. 
During the quality control, temporal, spatial consistency checks are performed with neighboring 
vectors extracted from the wind buffer. A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval 
of staggering AMVs at 0500 UTC is shown in Figure-2. To derive winds valid at 0500 UTC 
requires total seventeen images of 15-minute interval viz. nine images from INSAT-3D starting 
from 0100 UTC and eight images from INSAT-3DR starting from 0115 UTC. In the next steps 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 155 

wind buffer is calculated using sixteen wind pairs. In the following step quality control technique 
is applied to wind buffer to estimate the final output valid at 0500 UTC. 
14.4.2. Operational Implementation 
Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT 

Since accuracy of the wind is dependent on image registration and it is assumed here that 
all input images are well registered. The details algorithm for registration is defined in the 
data product document as provided by DP team. In this step a radiation model will be 
used to convert the instrument measured radiance into brightness temperature. This 
requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite. 
Step 2: Tracer selection from image 
 Read first two registered images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR. 
 Choose the tracer box in the first image (i.e. 3D) and calibrate the similar tracer box from 
3DR from second image into 3D equivalent. 
 Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients 
surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness 
temperature of the window. 
Step 3: Height assignment 
 For height assignment use brightness temperature from single satellite (i.e either 3D or 
3DR) to avoid height inaccuracies due to inter-calibration of two satellites. 
 Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness 
temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical 
model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height. 
 Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers. 
 Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. 
 Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned 
above. 
 Height optimization using minimized differences with first guess. 
Step 4: Tracking 

Before tracking the tracer selected from first image in the second image, bigger tracking 
area in the second image is calibrated with respect to the first image. 

The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance 
difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This 
search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind.

Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control 
 The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the 
winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The 
selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical 
region. 
 Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.

14.6.2. Methods of validation 
The evaluation of CMV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
Quantitative assessment of the CMV product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on 
NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes. 
The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting 
guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be 
employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII 
the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind 
production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The 
recommended three parts to the report. 
a. Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite 
winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with 
the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 
N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. 
b. Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor 
motion vectors through the last 12 months. 
c. Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. 
The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde 
report used for verification is given by 
 (VD) = [ (Ui Ur)2 + (Vi Vr)2 ]1/2 
The speed bias is given by 
The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is 
 N 
(BIAS)i = 1/N [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ] 
 i=1 
 N 
(MVD) = 1/N (VD)i 
 i=1 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 158 

And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is 
 N 
 (SD) = [1/N ( (VDi) (MVD) )2 ]1/2 
 i=1 
The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the 
squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, 
 (RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 
It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean 
component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the 
deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. 
To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector 
difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS 
guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s 
respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should 
be about zero. 
14.7. Technical Issues (Limitations etc) 
Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the 
registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the 
following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high 
resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geostationary satellite remote 
sensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion 
vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, 
though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and 
regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; 
however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. 
a. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval 

 N 
(U2) = (Ui Ur)2 
 i=1 

 N 
(V2) = (Vi Vr)2 
 i=1 

(MCD) = [ (U2) + (V2) ]1/2 (MVD) 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 159 

This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as 
well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the 
retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based 
on some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a 
quantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity. 
b. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment 
We plan to use IMDs operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. 
However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either 
IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution 
based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by 
IMDs regional model. 
c. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment 
To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the 
optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-
around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of 
RT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of 
cloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. 

d. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of 
cloud-tracers. 
The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the 
efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) 
methods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.

15.2. INTRODUCTION 
Weather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many aspects of the 
world's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important components of Weather 
and climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange of water substance between 
sea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and evaporation processes significantly 
affect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative assessment of precipitation is needed to 
improve understanding of the behavior of global energy and circulation patterns as well as the 
nature of climate variability. The choice of measured parameter has been influenced by the cost of 
installation, operation, longevity and temporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The 
land based techniques of rainfall estimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as 
about 70% of the Earth is covered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of 
rainfall is, therefore, a topic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and 
ocean for an extended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the 
improved identification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature 
and development of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and 
time span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The primary

scope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence, amount and 
distribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of rain gauges and 
weather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans have significantly 
limited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most variable quantities in 
space and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that other atmospheric 
phenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events and flash floods (Barrett 
and Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) imagers provide 
the rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the growth and decay of precipitating clouds. 
Microwaves provide the interaction of radiation with hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and 
limited swath widths of satellites with in tropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring 
Mission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al., 1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor 
Microwave Imager (SSM/I) series. 
15.2.1 Overview 
Operational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of precipitating 
systems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts for non-unique 
solutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett and Martin (1981) and 
Kidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the available methods. Petty (1995) has 
examined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over land. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001) 
has covered results and future perspectives from the geostationary orbit. The perspective varies 
widely from the relatively simple methods used for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and 
Ardanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991) to the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate 
estimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and Gruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al., 
1998). 
Recent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have been dramatic 
but the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary satellites is still 
indispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of geostationary satellites, the 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M series (Menzel and Purdom,1994) 
and the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning 
Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV 
triplet. Some of the new channels have been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High 
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) polar orbiters or have other heritages. 
Multispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and geostationary 
satellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels for cloud 
characterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at 
geosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring of 
precipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years since 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 164 

more and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will allow for 
global real-time cloud characterization. 
Cloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since been studied 
and documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993, Saunders and Kriebel, 
1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative properties are sensitive to the 
size distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase in the particle size increases the 
transmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the emissivity of the cloud layer. This 
latter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the 3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity 
of a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR window: there is a large contribution of reflected 
radiation at the cloud top. Clouds with small hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm 
radiance. An increase in cloud particle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the 
cloud top reduces the 3.9 mm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar 
radiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 mm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals 
are generally larger than cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud 
particles effective radius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth. 
Several methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from various cloud 
types. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and Nakajima and King 
(1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form between 22,000 and 35,000 
feet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates areas of moisture. Black depicts 
neutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a multispectral rainfall estimation technique 
based on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 
km2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) showed to be the critical limit beyond which a further 
increase in cloud cluster area does not result in higher rain rates. 
IR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for application to 
rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective rainfall areas using 
split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 1987a,b, 1997) and are 
instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 1985). These techniques 
rely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level cumulus clouds using the two 
window channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 m (the so-called split window). The information 
content of the split window channels partially corrects erroneous rainfall area delineation (and 
consequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple IR techniques producing better false alarm 
ratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 m channel of GOES-8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable 
for applications to rainfall detection and estimation. This channel was included for a long time in 
NOAA/AVHRR instruments (centered at 3.7 m) for a variety of purposes including ice 
discrimination and sun-glint detection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for 
rainfall retrieval using the 11 and 3.9 m channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use 
and sensitivity to the presence of ice and water vapor.

In the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be developed 
and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of NOAA from the 
data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard INSAT-3D satellite. 
VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid 
Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following 
channels: VIS 0.6m, NIR 1.6m, MWIR 3.9m, WV 6.7m, IR 10.8m, IR 12.0m . Each 
channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. 
15.2.2. Objectives 
There are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These 
techniques are now known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and INSAT Multispectral Rainfall 
Algorithm Technique (IMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at estimation of 
rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal requirements respectively. First 
GPI related objectives are the implementation of the algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the 
second one is related to the development of the algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber 
(2001). Originally the GPI technique has been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by 
National community for more than two decades. The IMSRA on the other hand is a new one and 
is developed 
The inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall 
in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection 
between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance emanating from 
cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only marginally even with 
significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal coverage of Geostationary optical 
measurements is the very strong point along with the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the 
same time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and 
thus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to 
the geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only 
low earth orbiting satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as 
on now. With the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single 
satellite (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisaged that a technique like 
GMSRA can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information 
can be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm 
(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the 
techniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below (mainly in 
cases of IMSRA). 
A1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method: 
1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) 
images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E 
using Arkins GPI method. 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 166 

2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg 
latitude/longitude. 
 3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 images 
a day). 
 4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data. 
 5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc. 
 6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales after 
due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. 
A2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) 
Technique: 
The relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive 
radiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, has 
not yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. There 
are numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information at scales 
smaller than the existing 1.0 products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at resolutions of 1 and 
down to the 0.10 0 and pixel scales) would be invaluable. There is also increasing demand from 
the meteorology and climate community for such products over extended periods. High-resolution 
rainfall information is available for limited areas using combinations of ground-based radar and 
dense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, where the need of high spatial and temporal 
rainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of India (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan 
Regions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-Arid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure 
necessary for this form of precipitation monitoring network is not in place. Recent developments 
mostly refer to microwave (MW) sensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and 
infrared (IR) sensors of geostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over. 
Thus a suit of both supplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the 
highly advanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near 
real time basis. 
The main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing a 
Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of the 
innovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements from polar 
orbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that combines satellite 
passive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both data types. Rainfall 
estimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal frequency of the IR data using 
rainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few years, a number of groups world wide 
have embarked on development of such techniques wherein the advantages of geosynchronous 
viz. vast coverage and near sufficient space-time sampling, and polar passive microwave 
radiometers viz. more physically based retrievals, are synergistically used to 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 167 

generate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g. Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola 
and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall 
Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. 
The technique has the following components: 
1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m-6.7m), 
which corresponds well with rainfall. 
2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain 
baring clouds. 
3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR TBs. 
4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds 
based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness temperatures 
colder than 240K. 
5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / 
SSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. 
6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top brightness 
temperature (11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds along with 
Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave Imager-TMI). 
7. The global bias correction based on a polynomial model of the suitable form designed on 
the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). 
8. The orographic correction is based on the climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and 
TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions (Mahesh et al., 2014). 
9. Cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Mahesh et al., 2014 and Woodley , 
Sancho and Vicente (1972) 
10. Validation of rainfall with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of algorithm. 
11. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid scales 
based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm. 
12. Estimation of daily merged rainfall products from both satellite based IMSRA and IMDs 
national Rain Gauge data.

15.3.2. Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs 
In addition to satellite data from INSAT-3D, radar and rain gauge data, and atmospheric moisture 
products (integrated precipitable water and relative humidity from 500-mb surface) obtained from 
the IMD/Eta Model analysis are essential on required grid spacing in different temporal scales. 
The gridded rainfall data from Doppler Weather Radars are needed from IMD at every half hourly 
time interval on its original resolution grids that will be regridded as is required by the proposed 
grid resolution for GPI and IMSRA techniques. The rainfall from those DWRs, which will be well 
calibrated using an appropriate site specific Z-R relationship over Indian regional sites of the 
respective radar locations will be used for validation. In some cases one hourly rainfall from fast 
response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas where the DWR coverage is 
not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain rates, and hourly and daily gauge 
rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important.

15.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications 
15.4.1. Overview: 
NOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. Heavy 
precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the global scale 
to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite-derived algorithms, 
conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide information on these various 
scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and flash floods. In the satellite data, 
global scale connections between the tropics and middle latitudes are observed. These 
connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor that are often associated with 
unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic 
scale, the 6.7 m water vapor is especially useful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and 
other features that are associated with upward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air 
resulting in the production of clouds and precipitation. Whether or not heavy precipitation and 
flash floods will occur are generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the 
mesoscale, infrared (10.7 m and 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate 
boundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and 
maintain the heavy precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect 
of anchoring, intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, 
movement, and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine 
how much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three

hours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal data 
sets used in this diagnosis. 
Large scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale 
precipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. 
Satellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) 
estimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) estimation 
of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day to a month e.g., 
Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some 
statistical relationship. 
In case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when 
available to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of hydrometeors 
during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 mm) and 5 (12 mm). 
The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness temperature, and the 12-mm channel 
is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated 
cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then 
subtracted from measurements of that channel to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm 
spectral band. 
In the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite sensor 
and surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness 
temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT. The 
GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship 
Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly rainfall over large 
areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal errors cancel each other 
in the aggregation procedure. 
Complete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3D,3DR VHRR data 
from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been attempted. Both of them are the 
operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development 
efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are 
given below: 
15.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm: 
15.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images 
The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or 
from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength, 
by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann 
law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to 
some temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is 
introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 171 

brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is related to its physical temperature T by following 
equation: 
Tb = T 
where, is emissivity of the object. If. = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if = 0, Tb = 0, its a white 
body; if 0 < < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. 
The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a 
atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this 
band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents 
of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, measured 
intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those surfaces, which 
are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated by effective emissivity 
times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will be referred more often as 
cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be measured from observations at a 
single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be unity. Then the temperature calculated 
from observed intensity of radiation is called `brightness temperature. Only when = 1, brightness 
temperature equals to black body temperature. 
The value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of lapse of 
temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with height, either 
from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be infrared from the satellite 
IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this context, because < 1 implies clouds 
which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). The more serious problem is distinguishing 
between cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick but are confined to the upper and middle 
troposphere, and cold clouds which extend into lower troposphere.

15.4.1.1.3. Operational Implementation 
Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT 
The INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, ., 2100 UTC, i.e., every 
three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, 
3DR, so that several pixels fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of 
each pixel in a given image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be 
calculated from a look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be 
ignored while within it are assigned to appropriate box. 
Step 2: Histogram Generation: 
After the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed to 
generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for 
1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and 30 to 130 deg 
longitude from the sub-satellite point. 
Step 3: Grid-wise Statistics 
Generate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg 
latitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. 
Step 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: 
The fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler than 
specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the 
fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the 
estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon 
will be carried out. This work indicated a high correlation between the fractional coverage 
of "cold" clouds and observed rainfall. It was determined that the highest correlation 
between the parameters was produced using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. 
An estimation method using linear regression was developed. The regression procedure 
yielded the simple estimation equation: 
R = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours] 
where R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of cloud-top 
temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours 
indicate the number of hours in the observation period. 
Step: 5 Validations: 
Regarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR and Surface Rain Gauges (SFRG) 
Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly desirable in and around the 
maximum validation sites in temporal window of every hour. 
Remarks: 
During the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided with a 
flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when more than 50% 
of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or Monthly scale average 
rainfall estimates.

15.4.1.2. IMSRA Technique: 
15.4.1.2.1. Theoretical Background: 
The developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) 
proposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along with 
innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) for the 
estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that 
1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in 
early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. 
2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. 
3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging clouds. 
4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a convective 
system. 
5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and thus 
effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during day time). 
6. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the 
associated instantaneous rain rate will be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain rate and 
cloud top brightness temperature relationship based on the equation developed using al 
large data base of IR-TBs and TRMM-Precipitation Radar data (Gairola et al. 2010b) The 
retrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations 
in India would be used for offline validation of the algorithm. This will be based on the 
large collocated data base of DWR and IMSRA rainfall within 0.1x0.1 deg resolution.

Several such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using measurements 
from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical explanation of rainfall 
with infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is common for GPI algorithm. In 
addition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images is being presented here in 
brief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with thicker clouds the probability of rainfall 
and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest for clouds warmer than -15 C. It is 
also noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the 
process of cloud growth and droplet growth rates. In clouds warmer than -15 C, precipitation 
results from coalescence. The large cloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets 
fall out of the cloud. However, the other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud 
temperature are also important. Differences in precipitation probability between marine and

continental clouds were attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of 
droplets, and difference in evaporation below the cloud base. 
Satellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able to provide 
accurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have but poor temporal sampling. 
Again the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias in regions where diurnal 
cycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous measurements of rainfall from microwave 
sensors are more accurate and thus are useful in calibrating other sensors like visible and IR. At 
present, the algorithms for the quantitative estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are 
quite successful but suffer from a scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. 
Theoretical and empirical studies addressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical 
assessment continues to appear. A definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because 
of the complex and variable microphysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis--vis 
coarser resolution of microwave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the 
rainfall data from the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several 
algorithms have been developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall 
used here is based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width 
of about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by 
NASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is most 
plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation of rain 
estimates from IR measurements. 
Following the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, IMSRA is thus proposed 
in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations 
of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud 
properties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. 
However our recent sensitivity study has suggested that the environmental correction factor 
(PWRH) is more suitable for larger scale rainfall (such as in GPI within 10 x10) than for (IMSRA 
within or less than 0.10x0.10). This factor now has not been invoked on IMSRA algorithm any 
more.

So far the IMSRA, that has been working as an operational algorithm at IMD combines mul-

satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous 
infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of 
techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses

cloud-top temperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995; 
Vicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and Gutman 
1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; Vicente et al. 
1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the number of steps which are already 
encorporated and described in Gairola et al. (2007). 
Based on a number of case studies and research works carried out during last few years, some 
more innovative elements are recognized for further refinements of the algorithm. In this regard, 
a three tier correction scheme is designed for IMSRA algorithm based on the intercomparison 
with TRMM-3B42 rainfall estimates. The Procedure adopts an overall correction of rain followed 
by corrections for orography and cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Woodley , 
Sancho and Vicente (1972). Finally to further refine the IMSRA rainfall estimates the synergistic 
use of INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall and rain gauge data from IMD is proposed based on the 
objective criteria. 
 Here the the original IMSRA algorithm has been retained as it is, except the environmental 
correction factor module has been dropped as it is adding more errors due to different decorelation 
lengths of rainfall and relative humidity & precipitable water. The flowchart of the modified 
algorithm is given in Figure 3 where recent developments have been added to the original scheme 
in above flowchart Figure 2, tested and implemented in many case studies by Mahesh et al. (2015). 
The global bias correction based on a priory data base is followed from a polynomial model of the 
form y= ai xi, i=0...2 and the orographic correction is based on the climatology and using an 
elliptical weighting function (Mahesh et al., 2014). The global bias correction is designed on the 
basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). The average bias 
between the rain estimates of TRMM-3B42 and IMSRA rain is absorbed into a polynomial model. 
Orographic correction is computed on the basis of a climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and 
TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions. It is applied as a symmetrically reducing elliptical 
weighting function of the form 
W= (A2 - S2) / (A2 + S2 2LF2) 
 A= d1 + d2 where d1 and d2 are the distances from the end points of a line with two foci as the 
ends and A is the length of semi major axis. LF is the distance between two foci. S is the sum of 
Euclidean distance calculated for every point from the two foci. The graphical representation of 
the function is given in figure 4.

The cloud growth correction takes two consecutive IR images and makes rain/no rain distinction 
based on the studies of Woodley and sancho (1971), Vicente et al. (1998) and Mahesh et al. (2014). 
It was observed that expanding clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming colder increases 
the rainfall rates and decaying clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce 
little or no rainfall. Under this assumption, cloud growth correction factor is applied to discriminate 
rain/no-rain situation. The correction factor is 0 when the cloud is becoming warmer and as 1 when 
the cloud is becoming colder. 
15.4.1.4 Case Study 
Figure 5 shows the spatial comparison of rainfall estimates based on present IMSRA and after 
correction with TRMM-3B42 on 15 July 2014. The comparison suggests that the over estimation 
tendencies of IMSRA algorithm has reduced considerably by the correction scheme: central Indian 
region and the Bay of Bengal region shows the improvement in the improved version. Orographic 
regions also show significant improvement by the application of IMSRA correction scheme and 
the inherent under estimation tendencies have reduced in corrected version of IMSRA.

Domain : 
For both GPI and IMSRA the domain for rainfall estimation mainly would be 400 
S to 400 N, 300 E to 1300 E. 
15.6. Validation 
Rainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods 
mentioned above. These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, climate, 
hydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an idea of their 
accuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the satellite precipitation 
estimates against "ground truth" from rain gauge and radar observations. A thorough verification 
of satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their accuracy in a wide range of weather 
and climate regimes, give users information on the expected errors in the estimates, help algorithm 
developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good 
estimates of absolute accuracy satellite products are verified against very high quality radar and 
gauge data. However, these sites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial 
accuracy it is necessary to use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain 
gauge networks. While these verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, 
their errors are usually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on 
short time scales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial 
scale are required mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges. 
Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data 
on available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. 
The error analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A complete 
error statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation etc.) will be 
performed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months). 
Rainfall maps on every 1/2 hourly and daily basis on pixel and any desired bigger grid spacing 
will be produced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color 
shades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, monthly mean, 
seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE from IMSRA 
over meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis System Group. 
Accordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and validation.

15.6.2. Method of Validation: 
Currently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm reflectivity 
and velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development of cyclones 
providing quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds within and around the 
storm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing the variations in their 
amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in polarization state, DWR 
quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium within the pulse volume. The 
amount of received power from the distributed target depends on the number of particles within 
the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, shape, orientation etc. 
 The DWRs are located at various sites all over the country. All are working operationally. DWRs 
estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a 
function of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated 
to meet the validation needs. 
Ground-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISROs AWS etc), at high 
resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High resolution IMD 
DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several small size study sites 
with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for instance in 1x 1 degrees. 
The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5x 0.5 to 2x 2 degrees, depending on the 
density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal

rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 
1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison 
within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an hourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would 
be required on routine basis, preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5x0.5 grids. 
Pre-launch Field Experiments 
Pre-launch validation campaign were launched earlier for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A based 
rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D, 3DR. A three months period will be selected (mainly 
rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain gauges and the 
algorithm will be tested. 
Post-Launch Special Field Experiments 
Many of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented for the 
measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in 
various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be utilized for the 
INSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the validation campaigns 
(timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual consultation with IMD. 
15.7. Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges): 
To merge in situ rainfall data from the AWS rain gauges with INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall 
estimates, one of the simplest and state-of-the-art techniques, called the successive correction 
method (Cressman, 1959; Thiebaux and Pedder, 1987) has been found suitable enough for 
objective analysis,. It involves the successive modification of satellite rainfall estimates based on 
observed rain gauge rainfall data. The objective analysis scheme benefits from the relative 
advantages of satellite and in situ data. In this method, the background field is corrected by the 
observed values iteratively during several analysis scans until the correction between the 
interpolated value and actual observation converges (Gairola et al. 2015). The interpolated weights 
are computed using the distance-dependent scheme and the correction (C) (Cressmaqn 1959) is 
done using the following equation: 
C = ( W (P0 Pp)) / N 

 (1) 
where Po is rainfall at the observation point, Pp is the interpolated grid point data at observation 
point, N is the number of observations, and the weight (W) is given by 

W= (R2 d2) / (R2 + d2) for d2 R2 

 = 0 for d2 > R2 

(2) 
where R is the radius of rainfall influence and d is the distance of the in situ data point from the 
grid point. The appropriate radius of rainfall influence is determined by the spatial autocorrelation 
analysis of daily IMSRA derived rainfall data. In recent study by Gairola et al. 2015), the objective 
analysis applied for rainfall estimates show noticeable improvement over the satellite-based 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 185 

rainfall estimates. Comparison with independent rain gauge observations shows a considerable 
improvement in terms of correlation, bias and root-mean-square error after objective analysis, 
especially over the regions where density of rain gauge is fairly good. Overall results reveal that 
the synergistic use of satellite and in situ observations has potential for more accurate rainfall 
estimations over the Indian monsoon region.

15.7.1. Major Conclusions 
 The overestimation tendencies of IMSRA Rain can be considerably reduced by new scheme 
(Cloud growth & global bias correction). 
 Orographic region shows significant improvement by the climatological orographic bias 
correction. 
 Finally the merged rainfall over India from IMSRA and surface rain gauge data shows the

improved rain estimates at a 0.1 latitude 0.1 longitude spatial resolution. 
 While the modified IMSRA rain products will be available after every half hourly, the merged 
products will be generated every next day for daily rainfall subject to the availability of rain 
gauge data from IMD. 
15.8. Future Scope 
Due to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earths surface it is important that corrections 
be applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes. Conventional 
means are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite measurements are now 
commonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent observations from visible (VIS) and 
infrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that estimates of precipitation are indirect and 
therefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to surface rainfall variations. More direct 
measurements of precipitation through the use of passive microwave (PMW) instruments are 
somewhat restricted due their relative infrequent sampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms 
for merging of microwave data with IR images to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal 
resolutions of the IR sensor is highly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall 
estimates using the temporal sampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the 
microwave estimates, avoiding the mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At 
present we have proposed to use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves 
for the rainfall estimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground 
truth. In future this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and 
microwave measurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall 
than any of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone. 
In future sensitivity studies could be made to estimate rainfall over the Indian monsoon region by 
the synergistic use of the geostationary INSAT-3D -derived IMSRA rainfall estimates and rain data 
from GPM Microwave Radiometer (GMI), using a suitable objective analysis method. This will 
benefit from high spatial and temporal resolutions of the geostationary satellite and infrequent but 
more accurate microwave based rainfall estimates.

16.2. Introduction 
This document describes the land surface reflectance retrieval algorithm for the MIR spectral band 
(3.8-4.0 m) of Imager sensor of INSAT-3DR. MIR reflectance consists of both reflective and 
emissive parts. Previous studies have shown that, full radiance (reflective and emissive) can not 
be used for the studies involving global studies, where temperature gradients are due to the 
latitudinal/topographical variations. We remove the emissive component using the brightness 
temperature computed from the 11 m channel and making simple assumptions about the 
emissivities and transmittivities in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 m. These assumptions are 
found to be conservative in the expected range of temperatures(T > 290 K). More appropriate 
values of emissivities and transmittivities would be adopted in the subsequent version of the 
algorithm, which would evolve with time and experimentation. This algorithm is analyzed through 
the comparison with the collocated and synchronous MODIS/METEOSAT surface reflectance 
products. 
16.2.1. Overview and background 
Mid-IR channel on Imager can be utilized for the detection of dark dense vegetation, burned areas 
etc., which can be used for land use/cover dynamics related studies. Red and NIR channels are 
traditionally used for detecting burned areas. However, these channels are highly affected by the 
aerosol scattering and absorption caused by the biomass burning (Kaufman and Remer, 1994), and 
hence affects the values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). MIR part of the 
spectrum is also sensitive for the changes in the state of the vegetation (due to active chlorophyll 
associated with liquid water in the leaves), but it is virtually unaffected by the presence of most of 
the types of aerosols (except dust). Monitoring the MIR reflectance can help to study the vegetation

cover more reliably. However, MIR reflectance should be used with caution for the studies 
performed over global scales, only reflected component of the MIR should be utilized (Libonati et 
al., 2010). The emitted component of the signal may not represent the intrinsic properties of the 
surface. We remove the emissive component using the brightness temperature computed from the 
11 m channel of INSAT-3DR and making simple assumptions about the emissivities and 
transmittivity in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 m. 
16.2.2. Objective 
The main objective of this document is to briefly present the algorithm to generate surface 
reflectance (only reflective component) for the MIR band of INSAT-3DR Imager.

 16.4.1. Overview 
1.4.1.1 Theoretical Background 
In the thermal infrared spectral region and in the day time observations, thermal emission and solar 
reflection are in the same order of magnitude (Petitcolin & Vermote, 2002). Assuming cloud free 
atmosphere under local thermodynamic equilibrium, the sensor measured MIR radiance IMIR is 
given by the following equation (A.-L. Li et al., 2013):

Where, R is attenuated (by atmosphere) radiance from the ground (path 1 in the following figure), 
 is the transmittance of the atmosphere. The second term on the right hand side, Rat is the upward 
atmospheric thermal radiance (path 2 in the figure), and Rsc Is the upward solar diffusion radiance 
resulting from atmospheric scattering of the solar radiance (path 3 of the figure). R can further be 
decomposed in the following equation (path 4 to 7 in the figure).

B(Ts) represents the radiance emitted by the surface due to its physical temperature (Ts), and its

blackbody at equivalent wavelength). and are view zenith and azimuth angles respectively. 
Rat is the downward atmospheric thermal radiance. Rsc is the downward solar diffusion radiance.

The transmission functions depend on the temperature and water vapor in the atmospheric column. 
In the present version of the algorithm, we would assume the emissivities and transmittivities to 
equal to 1.0. This assumption should cause errors within acceptable limits i.e., 0.02 in reflectance 
units in the retrieved MIR reflectance. 
We would try and incorporate the more appropriate values of emissivities and transmittivities in 
the subsequent version of the algorithms. 
16.4.2. Operational retrieval Implementation 
The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: 
Step 1: Extraction of the radiance (of MIR and 11m) and WV data. 
Step 2: Preprocessing of all the ancillary inputs in terms of bringing all the inputs on the same 
geometrical scale. 
Step 3: Computation of the MIR reflectance (reflected component) using analytic equations (4 
and 5, substituting value ot T from 4 into 5).

16.6.2. Methods of validation 
Collocated data of INSAT-3DR and MODIS/METEOSAT would be compared over various 
uniform targets of different reflectance, for example over soil, vegetation and over some bright 
targets. 
16.7 Technical issues (limitation etc.) 
Accuracy of the product will depend on the accuracy of the inputs. It would also be dependent on 
the calibration of the product. 
In the present version of the algorithm, we would assume the emissivities and transmittivities to 
be equal to 1.0. This assumption should cause errors within acceptable limits i.e., 0.02 in 
reflectance units in the retrieved MIR reflectance. We would try and incorporate more appropriate 
values of emissivities and transmittivities in the subsequent version of the algorithms. 
Emissivity/Temperature discrimination is not attempted in the present implementation. 
16.8 Future Scope 
Correction for the emission component and out of band correction in a more accurate manner 
would be attempted.

17.2. Introduction 
The process of evapotranspiration (ET) acts as one of the main drivers of the hydrological or water 
cycle. One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between the energy and 
water cycles. The potential ET rate (ETo) is influenced by several factors such as solar radiation, 
wind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among them, solar radiation is the most 
sensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% variability of ETo . The potential evapo-
transpiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass reference evapo-transpiration (ETo), is expressed in 
terms of amount of water transferred per unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface 
covered with a uniformly and actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ETo represents the 
evaporative demand of the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply 
of moisture leads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable 
widely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input in soil 
water balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-transpiration data to 
provide acceptable estimate of plants water requirements. This would provide regional water 
demand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural growing season. The combination of 
spatial rainfall with ETo would help in monitoring water deficit and surplus during a growing 
season for rainfed agriculture. 
Some contours of monthly climatic ETo have been generated by Department of Agricultural 
Meteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements of limited surface 
observatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will propagate large errors. No digital 
map of ETo is available to scientific community, modelers, resource managers and planners in 
India. Moreover, real-time updated spatial ETo product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly 
scales would aid in knowing the intra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors 
and their impact on deviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall

and PET) is essential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations. 
Therefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as crop 
forecasting. 
17.2.1. Overview and background 
The latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is significant 
in weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973; Rowntree, 1991; 
Anderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of evaporation has been known since 
approximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch), most of the understanding 
of the governing factors has been achieved in the last two centuries. Dalton (1802) was the first 
who proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit (esateact) of the near surface air to the 
evaporation rate. Later, many empirical relationships were developed based on other 
environmental factors (Blaney and Criddle, 1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based 
on available energy considerations and turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his 
evaporation equation for natural surfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as 
potential evapotranspiration (PET). Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman 
equation in which biophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance the now 
well-known PenmanMonteith (P-M) combination equation that allowed for vegetation control 
on transpiration rates. 
Choudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as remotely sensed 
solar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and weather station measurements) 
and vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good evapo-transpiration estimates for low-
resolution applications such as worldwide scale and monthly time step. The accuracy is limited by 
the high uncertainties provided by satellite-sensed vapor pressure estimation. 
Later, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT observations from 
Heliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to estimate ETo using 
Hargreaves approach. The ETo can also be available as forecast bi-product from weather 
forecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted radiative fluxes and operational short-
range forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather elements from model for a limited winter 
months showed that the incident shortwave radiative flux produced the highest root mean square 
error to the tune of 110% (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ 
measurements from INSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS). 
However, the errors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric 
pressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over plain and 
pleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to increase in the hilly 
terrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET0 would have substantial errors propagated 
mainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the other hand, the operational product on 
daily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced around 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) 
with respect to same ground reference and the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 202 

weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud 
flagging and the spatial resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected 
to produce substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily 
insolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative humidity, 
wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional product of potential 
evapo-transpiration. 
17.2.2. Objectives 
The objectives of this document are : 
 To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ETo) based on 
Penman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model) 
 To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs average 
operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution to generate 
product of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution 
 To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for 
automation of ETo product generation 
 To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results 

17.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 
17.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D) 
The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), 
Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT 
3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system, which was launched at 
geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR 
(1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with 
nineteen sounder channel. The spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km 
x 4 km for MIR, WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data 
Processing System (IMDPS) provides both full-globe and sector data products in all the bands 
at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 
48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for 
servo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D data products 
scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse 
Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 
columns for Asia Mercator sector product.

17.2.3.2. Operational insolation product 
A spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine 
integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations 
from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used to provide minimum ground 
brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness 
temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day 
aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to 
obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout 
the day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 
2012b) will be operationalized and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution 
with Transverse Mercator projection routinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). 
17.2.3.3. Operational product of WRF short-range forecast 
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for 
All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation 
model with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. This version employs 
Arakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a fully compressible system of equations. 
The terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-ordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in 
vertical. The time-split integration uses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for 
acoustic and gravity wave modes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the 
WRF Single Moment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi 
ensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University (YSU) 
planetary boundary layer scheme. 
The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 
km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260235, 352373 and 676721 in x and 
y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top 
of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all 
available conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model 
initial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at 
MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database 
and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar 
et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast). 
The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at three hourly interval upto 
72 hours. 
Examples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast product of air 
temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over Indian region are shown 
in Figure 1.

17.4. Algorithm functional specifications 
In 1948, Penman combined the energy balance with the mass transfer and derived an equation to 
compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard meteorological records of 
sunshine, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This combination method was further extended 
to vegetated surface by introducing resistance term. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have 
been added to the original equation of Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) from

The radiation striking perpendicular at the top of the earth's atmosphere called the solar constant 
(0.082 MJm-2min-1). The local intensity of radiation is dependent on angle between the direction 
of Sun's rays and the normal to atmosphere. This angle will change within a day and with latitude 
on different days of the year. Solar radiation received at the top of the earth's atmosphere on a 
horizontal surface is called extraterrestrial (solar) radiation, 
a
R . It is computed using astronomical 
units as listed by Iqbal (1983).

The radiation penetrates the atmosphere, some of the radiation is scattered, reflected or absorbed 
by the atmospheric gases, cloud and dust. The amount of solar radiation reaching horizontal plane 
is known as the incident solar radiation at surface Rs. The Rs should be in MJm-2day-1.

The longwave radiation emission is proportional to the absolute temperature of the surface raised 
to the fourth power as per Stefan-Boltzmann law. The net radiation leaving the earth's surface is 
however, less than emitted due to the absorption and downward radiation from the sky. The 
atmospheric constituents like water vapour, clouds, carbon dioxide and dust are absorbers and 
emitters of longwave radiation. Their concentration should be vital for assessing the net outgoing 
radiation. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is corrected for water vapour and cloudiness by assuming 
the concentration of other atmospheric constituents remain constant.

The above equation is valid for station elevation less than 6000 m having low air turbidity. The

elevation and assuming that the average angle of the sun above the horizon is about 50o.For areas 
of high turbidity caused by pollution or airborne dust or for regions where the sun angle is 
significantly less than 50o so that the path length of radiation through the atmosphere is increased,

17.7. Study of Potential Evapo-transpiration with K1 VHRR data 
The spatio-temporal pattern of monthly cumulative ETo for year 2011 is shown in Figure 3. The 
gradual increase and decrease was observed throughout the year with the seasonal transition. 
Monthly ETo linearly increased throughout India from January to June and then decreased in 
monsoon during July and August. After that, gradual rise in September coincident to higher 
insolation due to with drawl of monsoon. The ETo again decreases in October and November but 
there is rise in western part of India during December due to increase in day length in last dekad 
of December. 
17.7.1. Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting 
The sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using Sobol method. It 
consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent samples of N repetitions 
(rows) and k input variables (columns), retrieved from existing data or randomly generated data 
from the probability distribution function (PDF) of each k input variable. One or several variables 
in the first sample are substituted by the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each 
of the (2k - 1) possible combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, N runs 
of the model are computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called 
sensitivity or Sobol indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition of the 
total variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous variations of the 
k model inputs.

Figure 3. Example of monthly distribution of ET0 from VHRR insolation and WRF forecasts over 
Indian region 
In oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest area 
(SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from November to 
February), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET0 values calculated using P-M method 
(e.g. 38% of ET0 total variance in January). Then come relative humidity and air temperature (32% 
and 17% of ET0 total variance in January, respectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air 
temperature and daily amplitude of relative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration 
process during winter. This trend changes during March and October. From April to September, 
ET0 is mostly sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in 
July). From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature 
and their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of ET0 
variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to other 
variables variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during summer, and 
wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B). 
In Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation to climate input variables using P-M 
method in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a major impact on 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

ET0 calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most influent variable during 
summer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the great sensitivity of this Penman
Monteith formula to solar radiation during summer period, when ET0 reaches its highest values, 
and when its calculation is critical for irrigation process and ecological modelling. These results 
were obtained for Mediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work 
published by Gong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to 
similar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET0 during winter than 
it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of PenmanMonteith sensitivity to 
solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to 
ET0 calculation.

17.7.1.1. Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements 
The daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available through 
MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the period January 1, 
2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other routine inputs from WRF 
forecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 
estimates at regional scale following the steps mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based 
regional ETo estimates, the measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were 
used (Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables at 
30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six sites over 
different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for different time period as 
listed in Table 6. The ETo was calculated on daily basis using AMS half-an-hour average 
measurements.

17.7.1.2. Validation results 
A. Daily scale 
Daily ETo estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ETo computed from AMS 
measurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot is shown in 
Figure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ETo computed from AMS varied 
from 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ETo varied from 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different 
seasons for selected stations. The error analysis showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) 
varied from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the tune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table 
7). The overall pooled data set showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured 
mean. This was due to high fluctuation of ETo on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all 
six AMS stations. The estimated daily ETo showed underestimation as well as overestimation for 
all AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations.

B. Dekadal scale 
The daily ETo fluctuation was high and leads to high deviation from measured AMS mean so data 
were summed for 10-days for further analysis. The 10-days cumulative estimated ETo was 
validated with cumulative ETo from AMS data. The temporal 10-day ETo over different stations 
are shown in Figure 7 for six selected stations and error statistics are given in Table 8. The dekadal 
change in estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The seasonal change was also well captured 
in 10-day cumulative ETo. 
In Naraingarh, Punjab, the comparison was made for the period from January to April. In January 
and February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low radiation and 
temperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad. The rise and fall of 
computed ETo was well captured in estimated ETo during January to April. The RMSD was 9.3

mm which is 28.9% of AMS mean for the stated period. The 1:1 scatter (Figure 8) showed a 91 %

The site in West Bengal represents lower gangetic plain of agro-climatic regions having moderate 
cold season of January and February to moderate hot season during March and April. During this 
period rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal temporal profile of 
estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount of deviation during April. 
This may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop and was only captured in computed 
ETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. The temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 
to 30 mm in January with gradual rise in February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due 
to rise in temperature and radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the 
estimates. The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to 
April with respect to AMS. 
The central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at Powarkheda site. 
The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm. 
The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well 
throughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo 
always remained high as compared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After 
that, estimated ETo underestimated measured ETo. In January, both showed low values in the range 
of 30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm (estimated) 
in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 mm over ten days 
(16.6% deviation from AMS mean). 
The typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented here by 
Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and February. The data 
over monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for computation of ETo. In this part 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 221 

of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well captured by dekadal ETo variation during 
stated months. During July, ETo remained higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. 
The satellite estimated ETo showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season 
as compared to AMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD 
of 6.3 mm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo. 
The southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural scrub 
vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used for comparison 
with AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The 
difference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon season (January to February) 
but later on, the difference was reduced further in May and November. The data showed a RMSD 
of 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS mean). 
The island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions as 
compared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so climatic 
condition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and August to 
November were used for comparison. The AMS ETo on an average had a range of 23 to 50 mm 
throughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was observed for estimated ETo. 
The dekadal behaviour of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed little higher 
deviation during August and September. It showed RMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean).

17.7.1.3. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation 
The daily estimated and AMS ETo was compared for different time windows viz. 3-day, 5-day, 7-
day and 10-day. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured ETo gradually 
increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from daily to 7-day i.e from 
8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was 
nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah (BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer 
(6.3%) as compared to LPSC (Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. 
Similarly per cent deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the 
deviation drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day 
except than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days as 
marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from daily to 7-days 
and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help us use this ETo data in 
various applications on different time scales with known errors.

17.7.1.4. Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere 
Considering the results of PenmanMonteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to 
evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial ETo as no regular spatial 
record are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) attempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o 
x 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology 
Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS 
operational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast 
 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018

retrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with 
lysimeter data and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean. 
Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS equipped with 
humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using FAO-56 P-M method. They 
used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et 
al. 2004). The study found that most of the errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to 
uncertainties in retrieving daily solar radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 
1.32 mm (11% to 110% from daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of 
ETo mean value) at 0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% 
of ETo mean value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational 
product of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05grid for estimation of ETo at 
0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from measured mean) but 
it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and further in monthly scale (21% 
from monthly mean). The overall error at different temporal domain were found in good harmony 
with reported errors in other part of world. 
17.8. Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues 
The following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of ETo 
estimates and its comparison with ground reference 
(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS 
The FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and radiation 
data from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct measurement of 
radiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in terms of standard energy 
units. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The sensitivity analysis of P-M method by 
Gong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) highlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were 
clearly the most influent variables for ETo estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data 
from AMS are used. But these measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. 
Since vegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS 
would definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates from 
integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables. 
(ii) Scale mismatch 
Spatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel area while 
the average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale mismatch puts constrain in 
validation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with INSAT 3D. 

 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 

 226 

(iii) Difference in time sampling 
For spatial ETo, daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at instantaneous 
snapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-hourly averages from 
AMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets 
(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging 
The product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of 
approximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ETo estimates have higher errors 
during the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud dynamics such as Diglipur 
(A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc. 
(v) Quality of WRF forecast 
An initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-2C, RH of 
5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. The inherent errors 
in first three variables will have implications on the overall error budget. 
17.9. Future scope of improvement 
Recent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT 3D insolation algorithm 
using additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. Much of the 
uncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully be improved. 
Recent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed improvement 
in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of real-time satellite based 
other land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture would definitely help in 
improving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work should address the retrieval / 
estimation of those variables from Indian geostationary satellites. 
The INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. This 
would reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation.
