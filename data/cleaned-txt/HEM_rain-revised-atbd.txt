Abstract: 
The Hydro-Estimator (H-E) is a INSAT-3D based high 
resolution rain estimation method which combines NCEP 
model parameters with satellite observations. The Hydro-
Estimator developed at SAC is based on similar operational 
method 
at 
NOAA/STAR. 
The 
H-E 
is 
operationally 
implemented. This report addresses the validation of H-E in the 
present form. It is found that the H-E in its present form works 
well over most parts of the country but has weakness over hilly 
terrains. The problem is identified and a modified H-E is 
proposed. The modified H-E shows a good representation of 
rain over hill terrains. Overall, it gives a correlation of 0.78 and 
rms difference of 46.64 mm when compared with weakly 
meteorological 
subdivision 
surface 
measurements. 
Its 
comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 also provides the same 
correlation and rms difference. It is also found that comparison 
statistics of weekly met subdivision averaged surface 
observations with H-E is nearly same as that with 3B42 V7. 
However, 
the 
week-by-week 
comparison 
of 
surface 
measurements with H-E is more stable than with 3B42 V7. In 
daily 0.25ox0.25o grid, the correlation and rms difference over 
land between surface observations and H-E is 0.47 and 25.40 
mm/day. A slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and lowered rms 
difference of 22.40 is observed between H-E and 3B42 V7. 
These comparison statistics are in agreement with comparison 
of surface observations with 3B42 V7. The similar comparisons 
over oceans are conducted between H-E and 3B42 V7, which 
show a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h. 
The advantage of H-E over 3B42 V7 is its near real time 
dissemination. Report provides details of the study.

1.0 Introduction 

Conventionally rainfall over the ground is measured using rain gauges and radar. Rain 
gauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of 
the precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of 
the rain gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of 
various rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, 
etc. On the other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their 
coverage is limited due to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to 
poor calibration of radar reflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, 
ground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe 
weather conditions, ground based observation network often fail to work. In view of the 
limitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the 
precipitation over large area is by using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer 
frequent uniform coverage over large area. However, the satellite measurements also 
suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR methods suffer from their inability to sense 
hydrometeors directly (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), microwave measurements suffer 
due to their coarser spatial and temporal resolution, rain variability within their large 
footprint referred as beam filling problem, uncertainty in the drop-size distribution, drop 
temperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops etc. (Varma et al, 2003, 
Varma and Liu, 2006, Varma and Liu, 2010, and Varma and Pal, 2012). 
Due to inherent inability of IR measurements to directly sense the hydrometeors, the 
rain retrieval using them is always indirect in nature. In the past, there are a number of 
methods developed for rain estimation (barrett and Martin, 1981); they range from very 
simple algorithms in which brightness temperature (Tb) is directly related to rain rate 
(e.g., Arkin et al., 1989) to those which involved complex hypothetical models (e.g., 
Scofield, 1987). Scofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense 
precipitation over a storm. His method called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) 
that used half-hourly satellite images to measure the precipitation over the active area 
of a storm. His technique involved the skill of a trained meteorologist to find out active 
portion of a storm. He also utilized the total atmospheric precipitable water (TPW) and 
water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for dry/wet environment and 
equilibrium level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm clouds. This method 
was found to be successful for measuring precipitation but was highly subjective and 
needed continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the precipitation 
amount. Thus, it was found difficult to implement it with ease. Successively, an 
alternate method called Auto-Estimator (A-E) was developed. The aim of the A-E was to 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 
4 

provide an automated method without human intervention and that could automate the 
subjective nature of the IFFA, but A-E failed on many occasions because many features 
of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-Estimator is most recent of the 
attempts by NOAA/NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated (Scofield and 
Kuligowaski, 2003). The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not 
present in IFFA or were defined differently. 
A brief summary of the Hydro-Estimator is provided in section 2 below. Further details of 
Hydro-Estimator technique can be found in Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document 
(ATBD) (Varma and Gairola, 2013). 

2.0 Hydro-Estimator 

The H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-
E method, the relationship between 10.7 m brightness temperature (Tb) and rain rate 
(mm h-1) (R) is defined as: 

R = a exp(-bTb
1.2), -----(1) 

where, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 
(Vicente et al. 1998). The A-E method provides same relationship for core and non-core 
precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value for core 
rain and is hereafter referred as (Rc). In H-E, the rain is determined by the cloud growth 
at the given pixel relative to the surrounding pixels. The H-E method ensures heavier 
rain for growing clouds, in the upwind portion of the storm with overshooting tops. The 
core and non-core fractions of the precipitation are identified and different R-Tb 
relationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the 
convective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the 
coefficients a and b are dynamic in nature, and which depends upon available TPW as 
provided by National Centre for Environmental Predictions (NCEP/NOAA) Numerical 
Weather Prediction (NWP) model derived fields. This allows higher precipitation value 
for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained with precipitation value of 0.5 mm 
h-1 at Tb =240 K, and a precipitable water (from NCEP model) dependent value at Tb 
=210 K. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain at any pixel is limited depending 
upon availability of TPW. This allows the maximum precipitation as a function of 
available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm/h is restricted to 40 times 
the precipitable water in inches. 

If a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In 
principle, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate 
curves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical 
maximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity. 

For a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb and Rn is given as: 

Rn=(250-Tb) * (Rmax/5) -----------------(2) 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 
5 

Rmax is again a function of PW. Rn is not allowed to exceed - corresponding Rc rain 
rate or 12 mm/h, whichever is lower. 

In H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is considered to comprising of core and non-
core fractions. This is worked out by considering an area of 101X101 pixels 
surrounding the pixel under consideration. The minimum, mean and standard deviation 
of Tb (Tmin ), in this area is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual 
region of interest. Within this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation 
() of Tb are determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel 
is determined through the parameter Z, 

Z = (Tmean- Tb)/ ----------(3) 

The minimum and maximum allowable value of Z are 0 and 1.5. 

If Z < 0; H-E rain (R) = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective 

Otherwise, R = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3) 

Rc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW 
from NCEP NWP model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the 
pixel rain rate R reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if 
Z=0, the pixel rain rate R is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). 

In fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, 
and hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. 
Thus, this same computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, 
and the final rain rate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to 
this is if the rain rate computed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not 
considered in the final rain rate calculation. 

The (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus 
estimated is further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and 
also for the precipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved 
for such modifications are as follows: 

2.1 Correction for Wet/dry Environment 

A small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb) values is carried out to account for 
wetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of 
the precipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the 
brightness temperature at 10.7m is set for drier or wetter environment. This is carried 
out in two steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the TPW 
value to compute rain rate from (3). In the second step, first, the relative humidity (RH) 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 
6 

itself from the NCEP model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then 
depending upon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made. 

2.2 Warm-top modification 

The equilibrium level or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following a 
parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the 
parcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the 
convection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops with 
that of equilibrium level. This level lies below tropopause for the warm rain. 

In H-E method, NCEP model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine 
equilibrium temperature (Teq) of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels 
that are warmer than the equilibrium level temperature. 

 If the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb of the 
pixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows: 

Tb [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less) 
 If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows 
Tb [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) 

2.3 Orographic Correction 

Corrections for the orography induced rain and the rain from warm clouds are also 
applied. This correction is carried out to ensure enhanced rain amounts along windward 
side and reduced rain amounts along leeward side of the mountains. The orographic 
correction is carried out by determining by gradient of the elevations in the direction of 
the prevailing 850 mb level winds (Vicente et al., 2002). 

3.0 Sample Results and comparisons 

The H-E method which is currently operational at Indian Meteorological Department 
(IMD) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) uses INSAT-3D Imager thermal 
infrared (TIR) observations at 10.7 m along with environmental parameters taken from 
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to make a quantitative assessment of the 
precipitation. The H-E technique provides rain rate at each pixel with every acquisition 
of the satellite data (presently, 4x4 km2 and 30 minutes for INSAT-3D). The procedure 
and coefficients are adopted from H-E method developed by NOAA/STAR. 

Hydro-Estimator performed reasonably well over the land and oceans. As an example, 
Fig. 1 shows the instantaneous H-E rain on 23 September 2013 at 1200 UTC from 
INSAT-3D along with H-E rain as derived by NOAA using Meteosat and rain from 
TRMM 3B41RT. There is a good qualitative agreement between rain rates derived 
using INSAT-3D and Meteosat. Though H-E rain by NOAA and by us uses the same 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 
7 

technique and coefficients, the difference between the two methods still exists due to 
their different inputs. While INSAT-3D based H-E algorithm used 0.5ox0.5o gridded 6 
hourly NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) model derived parameters whereas 
NOAA algorithm uses high-resolution ETA model derived fields. Nevertheless, there is 
good qualitative agreement between H-E rain derived from INSAT-3D and Meteosat. 
There is also fairly good qualitative agreement between H-E rain from INSAT-3D and 
from 3B41RT. The 3B41RT is microwave based hourly rain rates. 

Fig.1: Rain rate in (mm/h) on 23 Sep. 2013 at 1200 UTC from (a) INSAT-3D by SAC, 
(b) GMS by NOAA and (c) TRMM 3B41RT. 

Despite of having good agreement over most of the regions, the rain over the 
Himalayan region is not well picked up by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as from 
Meteosat. This issue is dealt in modified H-E that is described in the later part of this 
report. 

Figure 2 show another example of INSAT-3D derived instantaneous H-E rain 
associated with Phaillin cyclone from 10 13 Oct. 2013. The Fig. 2 (a) to (h) shows the 
development to decay of the cyclone in chronological order. The intense rain associated 
with eye-wall as well as spiral clouds bands of the cyclone is clearly seen. The H-E also 
very well picked up the eye of the cyclone as rain-free area. The distribution as well as 
the intensity of the H-E rain associated with cyclone is found to be in agreement with the 
observed history of the cyclone (Anonymous, 2014). 

The cyclone made a landfall on 12 Oct. 2013 at around 1530 UTC and caused intense 
rain in Orissa during 12-14 Oct 2013. The Figure 3 show the district averaged rain rate 
from H-E and a network of rain gauges from the state government of Orissa. A good 
agreement can be observed in rain distribution from H-E and surface observations. 

A scatter plot of H-E rain and surface observations from Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4.

The 3-days, 12-14 Oct. 2013, Orissa state averaged rain associated with the Phaillin 
cyclone from INSAT-3D H-E, surface observations, TRMM-3B42RT and CPC is 
provided in Table 1.

Thus it can be concluded that INSAT-3D H-E rain is not only in a good qualitatively and 
quantitatively agreement with surface observations but it is also having a good 
agreement in its spatial distribution. 

Further, we have compared weekly meteorological (met) subdivision averaged rain from 
INSAT-3D H-E with corresponding rain values from IMD generated weekly weather 
reports (WWR) and TRMM-3B42RT for 7 weeks from 29 May to 16 July 2014 of the S-
W monsoon season. The Fig. 5 shows the inter-comparison of weekly met-subdivision 
averaged rain from H-E, WWR and 3B42RT. 

The Fig. 5 shows a reasonably good agreement of H-E weekly rain with IMD WWR and 
TRMM-3B42RT. To examine the comparison statistics of H-E rain in better perspective, 
we have provided the comparison of 3B42RT with IMD WWR. It may be recalled that 
3B42RT is an IR and microwave merged product. 

Further comparison is made between hourly CPC 1oX1o latitude-longitude gridded rain 
with H-E rain for period from 23-27 October 2013. The comparison statistics is provided 
in Table 2 below. For comparison in smaller spatial and temporal scales, a comparison

of INSAT-3D H-E with TRMM 3B41RT hourly rain in 0.25oX0.25o latitude-longitude grid 
is made for period 20-24 Sep 2014. The TRMM 3B41RT is a microwave derived rain 
product and is available hourly.

4.0 Need for further Improvements in Hydro-Estimator 

The results presented in section 3.0 above show a reasonable good agreement 
between H-E rain and surface observations. The most of the result presented in the 
above section are dominated by regions that are either oceans or have moderate 
elevations from the sea level. Figure 6 below shows the comparison of IMD Weekly 
WWR met-subdivision accumulated rain for 7 weeks with corresponding H-E rain 
averaged over 4 typical high orographic met-subdivisions, viz. Arunachal Pradesh (AP), 
Uttrakhand (UK), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), 

The Fig. 6 shows that H-E rain estimated for areas with high altitudes is largely 
underestimated with respect to surface observations. Also, with regard to Fig. 1, as it is 
already mentioned in section 3.0 that the rain over Himalayan region is not well depicted 
by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as that provided by NOAA using Meteosat. In view 
of the observed underestimation of the rain by H-E in the present form over high altitude 
regions, it is desired to investigate its possible reason and accordingly modify the H-E 
method to make it able to better represent the rain over high altitudes.

subdivisions with high altitudes. 

5.0 Modified Hydro-estimator: 

As discussed the previous section, the H-E is not able to give satisfactory 
measurements over high altitudinal regions. This weakness of H-E is noticeable despite 
of the fact that the H-E method is designed with corrections for orography and warm 
rain. Herein we reinvestigated different corrections applied to the H-E method to work 
out procedures to make it better representative of surface observations, especially in 
high altitudes. 

Fig. 7: NCEP GFS model derived (a) TPW and (b) RH for a typical day and time. 

 Correction of NCEP derived TPW and RH 

It was observed in the NCEP GFS analyzed fields that TPW and RH values are very low 
in the Himalayan region. For example, Fig. 7 shows the TPW (in inch) and RH (in 
percentage) for a typical day and time, which shows very low value over Himalayan 
region. Such low values of TPW and RH in NCEP GFS fields are observed irrespective 
of date and time of the observation. Such low values are not supportive of the high rain 
rates in H-E method and hence the estimated rain is largely underestimated.

fields over Indian region of TPW (inch) at (a) 0000 UTC, (b) 0600 UTC, (c) 1200 
UTC and (d) 1800 UTC, and RH (percentage) at (e) 0000 UTC, (f) 0600 UTC, (g) 
1200 UTC and (h) 1800 UTC. 

In order to examine, TPW and RH values with respect to altitude, we have plotted 
conditional probability distributions (PDF) of TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage) 
conditioned to different altitudes over Indian region (i.e., 0-40 N and 65-100 E) from one 
full month (July 2014) of NCEP GFS analyzed fields separately for each of the 
observation times (i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC). This is shown in Fig. 8. In 
which it can be seen that TPW and RH have nearly same PDFs irrespective of time of 
observation. Also the TPW and RH values are always very low at high altitudes. For 
example, for altitude above 4000 m, the TPW is always less that 1 inch and RH is 
always less than 50%. In order to have their values at higher altitudes comparable to 
that at lower altitudes, we have carried out histogram matching with respect to their

corresponding values between 0-500 m values. By histogram matching we intend to 
make their probability of occurrence same at all altitudes. The Fig. 9 shows the 
corresponding PDF values before and after histogram matching.

model fields at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC of (a) TPW, (b) TPW after

Figure 9 (a) and (c) show the conditional PDFs of TPW and RH with all time data from 
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 (b) and (d) show them after carrying out histogram equalization. The 
Fig. 9 shows that with histogram equalization the probability of occurrence of TPW and 
RH value is nearly same irrespective of altitude. The correction based on histogram 
equalization (Fig. 9) is applied to TPW and RH values shown in Fig. 7. The modified 
TPW and RH values are provided in Fig. 10. The Fig. 10 looks similar to Fig. 7 except 
corresponding values over Himalayan region which are now have higher values 
compared to those in Fig. 7. We expect that this correction in TPW and RH will help 
getting more representative rain values from H-E. 

5.1 Correction of Equilibrium Level / Level of Neutral Buoyancy Computation 

The Equilibrium Level (EL) or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following 
a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the 
parcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the 
convection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops from 
IR measurements with that of EL. This level comes before tropopause for the warm rain. 
This adjustment was initially developed to enhance rainfall in regions where the 
convective EL was too low (in height) for very cold cloud tops to develop, but where 
very heavy precipitation is still possible. 

If equivalent potential temperature of the parcel is e and sateurated equivalent potential 
temperature of the environment is es, then usually a parcel begins with e <es of the 
environment. As the parcel rises, conserving e, it will eventually have a e equal to the 
es of the environment; this is referred as the level of free convection (LFC). As the 
parcel rises above the LFC, it is positively buoyant and will continue to raise until 
eventually e is equal to the es of the environment again, this is referred as EL or LNB. 
Above the LNB the parcel becomes negatively buoyant and tends to return to the LNB. 
Assuming adiabatic ascent, i.e., no mixing of environmental air, we can determine the 
LNB for given sounding. 

Conventionally, the e and es are determined considering 1000 mb as the reference 
level. We find that by taking 1000 mb as reference the convergence of thermodynamic 
equations above hilly terrain is not always possible, and thereby it does not allow us to 
carry out correction for warm rain over such regions. Taking cognition of the fact that 
1000 mb is not a realistic level over hilly terrain where surface pressure is often much 
lower. We thus replaced this 1000 mb with surface temperature over hilly terrain in 
thermodynamic equations for e and es. This resulted in more often convergence of 
equations over hilly terrains. Figure 11 (a) shows the EL/LNB as computed using 1000 
mb as reference surface and Fig. 11 (b) shows the EL/LNB as computed with modified 
algorithm. One can notice the changes only over some regions (especially, Himalayas, 
Hindukush and Arabia) where with modified scheme the computation of LNB is now 
possible.

model fields with (a) 1000 mb as reference surface, (b) actual surface pressure. 

5.2 Modification in orographic correction 

The orographic correction uses 850 mb wind speed which is unrealistic level over high 
altitudes. The 850 mb level is considered for avoiding the boundary layer for surface 
pressure close to 1000 mb level. For high orographic regions, this needs to be modified 
and replaced with realistic level. This is done in the modified algorithm; we can see the 
850 mb u-wind component on a typical date and time in Fig. 12 (a), and modified wind 
input to orographic correction in Fig. 12 (b). One can see the moderate changes in the 
wind only over orographic regions.

With above modifications, we examined the capability of H-E for measuring intense rain 
over Himalayas. Few examples are presented in the next section. We have presented a 
detailed validation of the modified H-E over all the other regions too. 

6.0 Validation of Modified Hydro-Estimator 

The above modifications in H-E are aimed at improving rain over orographic regions. 
Hence the success of the changes in the H-E depends primarily on its improved 
performance over Hilly terrain, and its consistent or improved performance over all other 
regions. We have taken two different cases of intense rain over Himalyas which were 
poorly represented by H-E. One is that of flash floods in Uttrakhand from 15-17 June 
2013 which resulted heavy flooding and huge loss of life and property. In June 2013, 
INSAT-3D was not available and hence we applied the modified algorithm to Kalpana-1 
VHRR observations and examined the performance. Figure 13 shows the rain over 
Uttrakhand region in the morning of 17 June 2013 when scores or people were perished 
in Kedarnath, Badrinath and other adjoining regions. The Fig. 13 (a) is H-E rain 
measurements without applying modifications and Fig. 13 (b) shows the H-E rain with 
modifications as described in section 5.0. We can see the mark difference in the rain 
intensity with corrections. 

Fig. 13: H-E rain in Uttrakhand on 17 June 2013 at 0200 UTC (0730 IST) (a) without 
modifications, (b) with modifications. 

The Fig. 14 (a) show the weekly averaged 13-19 June 2013 district rain from modified 
H-E. The state averaged rain from H-E is 316 mm. The Fig. 14 (b) is weekly averaged 
rain map for the same week from IMD WWR, which shows a value of 322.9 mm for the 
state of Uttrakhand. Thus, H-E with modifications provided in section 5.0 is able to give 
a very close to realistic weekly rain values over Uttrakhand.

The other case of intense rain over Himalayan regions that is presented here is that of 
intense rain and floods in Jammu and Kashmir during 3-5 September 2014. Figure 15 
(a) shows the rain from INSAT-3D H-E on 04 September 2014 at 1500 hr without 
applying modifications. It can be observed that modified H-E is able to capture very 
intense rain in the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region (Fig. 15 (b)), which otherwise it is 
not able to capture in Fig. 15(a). 

Fig. 15: Rain on 04 September 2014 at 1500 UTC from (a) without modification, and (b) 
with modification. 

The J&K state averaged H-E rain from modified algorithm for week from 3-10 
September 2014 is found to be of 245.78 mm which is very close to the IMD WWR 
provided rain of 267.7 mm. For the same week TRMM-3B42 V7 provides corresponding 
rain value of 95.33 mm. Thus the H-E rain from modified algorithm is better 
representative of intense rain in J&K during 3-10 September 2014 then TRMM 3B42 V7.

The above two case studies of very intense rain over hilly terrain gives us confidence 
that the modifications in H-E method as described in section 5.0, give more 
representative rain values over Hilly terrain. 

Further validations are carried out of the modified algorithm in different spatial and 
temporal scales with IMD daily gridded, weekly met-subdivision averaged (from WWR) 
rain values, and also with TRMM 3B42 V7, which is an IR and microwave merged 
product. 

We have computed the H-E rain from modified algorithm for 10 week period from 3 July 
to 10 September 2014. The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly 
basis and compared with rain values provided by IMD in WWR. A scatter plot of 
comparison is shown in Fig. 16. 

Fig. 16: Comparison of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged rain from H-E and 
IMD WWR for 10 weeks from 3 July to 10 September 2014. 

The Fig. 16 when compared with Fig. 5 (a), shows a marked improvement in the 
comparison of H-E rain with WWR rain values, both in terms of correlation as well as 
standard deviation of their difference. This is despite of the fact that range of the rain 
values plotted in Fig. 16 is higher compared to that in Fig. 5 (a). 

The Fig. 16 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the 
week-by-week comparison statistics is provided in Table 3 below.

The Table 3 shows a highest correlation between H-E rain WWR rain of 0.90 for a week 
from 4 to 10 September 2014 and lowest correlation of 0.64 for a week from 10 to 16 
July 2014. In order to see the comparison results in better perspectives, we have also 
used TRMM 3B42 V7 observations and compared their weekly met-subdivision 
averaged values with corresponding H-E and WWR rain values. This is shown in Table 
4 below.

If we compare Table 3 and 4, we may conclude that overall (with all 10 weeks of 
dataset) correlation of WWR with H-E is same as that with TRMM 3B42 V7. The rms 
difference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of 
these similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, 
the correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, 
whereas that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high 
value of 0.93. Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that 
between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-
E is also attempted and is shown in the Table 4. 

It may be recalled that 3B42 V7 is from state-of-art algorithm that combines IR and 
Microwave Measurements and adjust the biases with surface observations. Despite of 
these facts, H-E results are comparable (or even better) to that of 3B42 V7 
measurements. In order to see that how modified H-E measurements compare with only 
Microwave measurements of precipitation, we compared 2 weeks (3 16 July 2014) of 
weekly met-subdivisions averaged H-E rain with TRMM 3B41RT. The comparison 
results are shown in Table 5 below. The comparison shows poorer correlation between 
3B41 and WWR that that between H-E and WWR. Thus, modified H-E rain is having a 
better representation of the surface observations than that by only microwave based 
rain rates from TRMM 3B41RT.

averaged rain from 3B41RT with H-E rain with WWR and IMD.

We are also obtained 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD. 
Before using them for further comparisons in finer spatial and temporal scales, we 
examined their integrity vis--vis rain values provided in WWR. We averaged gridded 
rain values and generated weekly rain maps similar to those provided in WWR. The 
comparison statistics of IMD gridded dataset with WWR is provided in Table 6 below:

0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD with WWR.

We expect a near perfect comparison between IMD gridded data and IMD WWR but 
there exists marked difference between them.

The Table 3 shows the comparison between rain values from modified H-E and WWR, 
but that does not give any indication of performance of H-E in different meteorological 
sub-divisions. In Table 7, we have made comparison in different subdivisions and 
presented the statics. Herein comparison over Lakshadweep is not provided as that is 
considered to represent maritime environment. It can be observed that high correlation 
exist in all the subdivisions except in Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura 
(NMMT) and Coastal AP, which needs further investigation. Similar comparison 
between 3B42 V7 and modified H-E is also attempted, which is shown in Table 8. From 
Table 8, it can be observed that the correlation of modified H-E rain with 3B42 V7 over 
NMMT and Coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) is 0.32 and 0.64 which is not as poor as in 
Table 7. Thus any study to understand large difference in these two met subdivisions in 
Table 7 needs to take cognition of this fact that the 3B42 V7 and H-E are uniformly 
measured spatially averaged measurements. The coarser correlation as observed in 
Table 7 in NMMT and Coastal AP may be due to high variability of precipitation in these 
regions associated with geolocation error in the INSAT-3D observations (mean error of 
1-2 pixel error is possible) which may show poorer comparison with surface 
observations taken at fixed locations (Piyush et al., 2012). Other than these two regions 
the correlation between rain from modified H-E and WWR is reasonably good, 
especially in the regions with high altitudes like J & K, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand 
and Himachal Pradesh, etc.

The above comparisons are carried out in weekly meteorological sub-division scales. 
The rain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few 
seconds to any time scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random 
stochastic process. Therefore, rain comparisons in shorter time scales and from 
observations in different spatial scales lead to large errors (Piyush et al., 2012). 
Nevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from modified H-E 
method with gridded dataset from IMD. The comparisons are carried out for each of the 
met subdivisions as provided in Table 7 to table 9. The comparison statistics is provided 
in Table 10. 

The Table 10 shows a reasonable good comparison statistics for different regions. If all 
regions are considered together, the comparison shows a correlation of 0.47 and rmse 
of 25.40 mm/day. In order to see this statistics in proper prospective, similar comparison 
statistics of rain from TRMM 3B42 V7 and IMD gridded dataset is provided in Table 11, 
which show slightly improved correlation of 0.53 and rmse of 19.30 mm/day. The 
difference may be due to geolocation error is INSAT-3D which is suspected to have 
mean error of 1-2 pixels in geolocation due to anomaly in the star sensor, which has 
potential to degrade statistics in smaller scales.

A comparison of rain from modified H-E and TRMM-3B42 V7 in 0.25ox0.25o degree in 
each met subdivision is shown in Table 12, which show significantly higher correlations 
and smaller rmse for most of the regions. This is mainly due to spatially averaged 
measurement of rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 12 also shows 
the performance of modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be 
noted here that neither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset has provides measurements 
over oceans. So the comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing 
the quality of H-E rain over oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o 
gridded rain from H-E and 3B42 RT has a good agreement over oceans with correlation 
of 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 mm/day. If all area including land and oceans including and 
surrounding India are taken into consideration, the correlation and rmse between H-E 
and TRMM-3B42 V7 is 0.59 and rmsd of 22.44 mm/day.

7.0 Conclusions and Expected Accuracy 

The results provided above indicate reasonably good agreement of INSAT-3D H-E rain 
with surface observations. The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm 
are able to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to 
suffer from huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and 
its validation in smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). 
The results presented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison 
results of the global standard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a 
recent study by Tan et al. (2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution 
precipitation products including TRMM-3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that 
among 5 satellite based rain products, the 3B42 V7 and is the best performing with 
respect to surface observations, which on daily scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and 
rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much more diverse surface and climatic 
conditions with different cloud types and wide range of precipitation rates during S-W 
months, we achieve much higher correlation between modified H-E rain with surface 
observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E vis--vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is 
timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is 
available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D H-E is available within 15 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 
26 

minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users, 
especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical 
weather predictions. 

Based on above analysis, we can summarize the results as follows: 

1. H-E in the present form performs well over most parts of land and oceans but 
has found to have weakness over high altitude regions. 
2. The weakness of the H-E in high altitude areas is successfully addressed in 
modified H-E. 
3. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of 
0.78 and rms difference of 46.64 mm with surface observations from IMD weekly 
Weather Report (WWR). 
4. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of 
0.78 and rms difference of 45.15 mm with TRMM 3B42 V7. 
5. It is found that comparison statistics between modified H-E and WWR is 
comparable to that between TRMM-3B42 V7 and WWR. However, week-by-
week variation in the comparison statistics of H-E versus WWR is more stable 
than that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. 
6. Daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from modified H-E matches well with surface 
gridded observations over land with correlation of 0.47 and rms difference of 
25.40 mm/day. Slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and rms of 22.40 difference 
mm/day is observed when H-E rain is compared with TRMM 3B42 V7. The 
results are in tune with comparison between 3B42 V7 with surface observations. 
7. The comparison over oceans is not possible with IMD gridded surface 
observations hence comparison is done with daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain for 
modified H-E and TRMM 3B42 V7 and that show a correlation of 0.65 and rms 
difference of 15.88 mm/h. 
8. The H-E rain shows a good comparison in all the met subdivisions except in 
Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura (NMMT) and Coastal Andhara 
Pradesh, which are also poorly comparable with TRMM 3B42 V7. The reason 
needs to be further investigated. 
9. Over all, rain from modified H-E is comparable to TRMM 3B42 V7 with an 
advantage of near real time availability of measurements (within 30 minutes) 
compared to 4 months for the availability of TRMM 3B42 V7 product. 

The modified H-E is soon going to be made operational both at SAC and MOSDAC 
sites. A Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document is presently under preparation. 

8.0 Implementation Steps 

The modified H-E is already implemented offline and running flawlessly. The present 
operational structure of H-E module comprising of two main programs called HEM and 
HEG. The HEM takes Earth elevation model (ETOPO2) as static data input and NCEP 
GFS model file as dynamic input and provides the correction files for equilibrium level, 
SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015

orography, TPW and RH. The HEM uses three separate programs as subroutines for 
orographic correction, wind interpolation and a atmospheric thermodynamic model for 
the calculation of LNB/EL. The HEG takes INSAT-3D level1 files as input along with 
correction files to produce the rain at every pixel within the study area. This is illustrated 
in flow chart 1 (Fig. 17). In the modified scheme, new HEM removes the program for 
atmospheric thermo dynamics and includes the necessary model equations in the main 
body of HEM itself. The modified HEM also takes histogram equalization matched up 
files for each of the height bins of the parameter (TPW/RH) at surface to given elevation 
bin as static input files. The only change in input to HEG is that in modified program for 
H-E rain, it also takes as input to Earth elevation model file (ETOPO2).This is shown in 
Fig. 18.
